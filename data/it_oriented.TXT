the only reason java is still relevant is because it is shoved down the throats of high schoolers and college students.
Time to Git gud or uninstall then change career.
Web developers have plenty of job options these days. You can tap your connections and rely on word of mouth to build a portfolio of long-term clients (this can take years), you can look for clients in highly competitive marketplaces (that always come with trade-offs), or you can simply apply for a full-time remote job. However, if you value working on exciting and diverse projects with exclusive clients that have high growth potential, you should apply to Toptal. Once you‚Äôve passed Toptal‚Äôs screening process, you‚Äôll enjoy the freedom and flexibility of remote work without compromising your career potential.

Introduction to Perceptron in Neural Networks (Machine Learning).
Many beginners and some experienced programmers avoid learning data structures and algorithms because they believe it‚Äôs complicated and not useful in real-life applications.
Complexity theory describes how well an algorithm performs with respect to the size of the input and how it is implemented. In Layman‚Äôs term, it describes how good your algorithm is. Computers, although capable of performing impressive tasks, have their limitations. If you develop an algorithm that is so complex it current computers can‚Äôt run it, it might not be beneficial.
The imposter handbook has a chapter on complexity theory that is very simple to follow. MIT and Standford also offer free courseware to learn about complexity theory if you want more in-depth information.
Before you do that, my advice is to implement your algorithms and problem-solving skills using pseudo-code first. As we just discussed, an algorithm is a set of steps used to solve a specific problem. Pseudocode is defined as ‚Äúa plain language description of the steps in any algorithm.‚Äù This means pseudocode is used to describe an algorithm's steps as a form between plain English and programming languages.
Programming is not a solely theoretical thing. I used to do the following way: reading up on some concepts and practicing them right away on my computer. You learn by doing.
Programming is a puzzle that‚Äôs made up of zillions of technologies. I recommend narrowing down your expertise to a specific niche first and then build up your way to other applications.

When I just finished the third week of the professional React Developer Bootcamp at Juno College of Technology, but I started this journey of learning how to code almost two years ago.
There are sites like Pluralsight, DataCamp and Codecademy that have a lot of content and practices for a monthly fee or just continue learning from any free tutorials you find online.
One thing I can clearly say you that since I managed to Learn to program then you will also learn to program very easily. because till my higher secondary study I didn‚Äôt have any knowledge about programming and languages, but now I‚Äôm doing my IPG M.tech from IIIT Gwalior and managed to learn C, C++, JAVA, PYTHON, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and the list goes on.
At first, you should buy a C language book (the name of the book is ‚Äò let us C by Yashwant kanetkar‚Äô it is really a very good book and also beginner-friendly .along with that you have to watch YouTube videos regarding C language. And truly speaking reading books can increase the theoretical knowledge about a language but watching various kind of videos regarding a language helps you to write programs and you can get familiar with various kind of approaches to solve a single problem, and which I think is the more important thing to learn a language. so I‚Äôll suggest you that keep watch programming videos on YouTube as you don‚Äôt need to pay any amount for that.
after learning C language we should go for C++ as both C and C++ are very much similar kinds of language but the only major thing you‚Äôll learn here is OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOPs). I can assure you that within 1.5 months(you have to do regular practice) you will become an expert in the C++ language.
so till now you learn C and C++, after this stage, you can easily learn JAVA within 2 months, in JAVA you have to write more lines as compared to C and C++.but java is the gateway to enter in Android development(not JAVA you can use other languages also for android development).
Learning a programming language is just the beginning. In real life, developers don‚Äôt often create their own tools from scratch. They‚Äôre usually using a pre-existing framework or library, which is a tool that someone else created out of lower-level code. The reason for this is just one of practicality. There‚Äôs a rule in software development that tells us, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt reinvent the wheel.‚Äù.
The core skills of web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recommend taking a few months to get good at those. You can get started at Free Code Camp. Just make an account and start going through the curriculum until you finish your certs in Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms. DO ALL THE PROJECTS AND CHALLENGES. Those are the hardest part, but also the most important. Don‚Äôt skip anything. There‚Äôs no cost for Free Code Camp.
This is a monster course (over 30 hours of video) and it‚Äôs where we separate the kids from the big kids in this curriculum. Learning JavaScript is one thing, but making the leap into the complexity of real application development is another.
In the course above you get a taste of MySQL, but SQL is a very important skill and worth spending more time on. There are a lot of ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of SQL like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL but if you know one, picking up any of the others is easy. MySQL is a good place to start and can be used in professional projects, too.
You will also need to learn React and Redux. Stephen Grider has a good course on those. If you want to work as a professional developer, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to learn React and learn it well. This is a core skill. Why did I have you wait this long to learn it? Because having rock solid JavaScript fundamentals and a good understanding of how Node works is essential for React developers.
Whatever you pick, it needs to have a database, users, and authentication. It needs to have a back-end in Node and SQL, and a front end built in React.
Material UI is a React styling library that will help you build professional-looking sites and apps without having to write a bunch of boilerplate CSS. As a bonus, this course also covers the basics of Next.js, which is an important library for rendering React apps on the server rather than the client.
Keep all your stuff on GitHub once you learn Git. Make your learning projects private but your finished projects public. Later, you may want to take some of the early projects back off the public list, but you want some working code initially. You can also link to these projects from your profile using GitHub pages, a free service.
Remember those algorithms and data structures? You want to keep practicing them. Those questions come up in a lot of interviews, especially at larger companies. A great place to practice those types of challenges is at Leetcode.
No matter the route you take, it doesn‚Äôt really matter as long as you practice a ton. Look through the popular languages and decide which one you want to start with. I‚Äôd go with one of the following: Java, Swift, Python, C, C++, smalltalk, PHP. It doesn‚Äôt matter that much, and before you get a job doing it you‚Äôll probably want to have bounced around a little bit.
I don't recommend starting with a more complex language like C, but if you're worried that Java might be too simple for you then definitely try it out. Worst case scenario, you'll just have to spend a few weeks getting used to it instead of a few days. In my opinion though, the best way to get into programming is by learning Javascript and HTML simultaneously because they are both easy to learn and can produce some amazing results very quickly!.

They have very systematic flow, they will help you with the precoding work (installing ide, what is ide, etc), you can also take help from Google simultaneously, and gradually you will know what to do next.
Coding is a technique that is gaining popularity in the present. It's in such high demand that some high schools have incorporated programming into their courses. Coding and programming are commonly employed interchangeably, however they are distinct and you can find out more about the two here.
This is my career graph as of last year. I did thirteen different jobs before starting as a Data Analyst (highlighted in green) which was not a full programming job. But I started my way into programming. I still remember looking at the VB code and trying to figure out what ‚ÄúDim‚Äù stands for.
If you want a job during on-campus placements then first focus on Data structures and algorithms and CSE fundamentals subjects(computer networks, Operating Systems, etc).
Whenever it comes to Python, everyone say that, "It is the easiest programming language" and I totally agree.
Object-Oriented Programming Language- It has the OOPS (Object-oriented programming) concepts like inheritance and polymorphism but it also supports functional programming.
Dynamically Typed Language- It simply means it decides variable type in run type, so you don't have to specify the type of variable (you will understand it better when you will start learning).
Coding Ninjas have trained more than 50k+ students and they have more than 90% Course Completion rate which means coures are so addictive that everyone completes it.
Content is designed by IIT & Stanford Alumni, who also have experience of working in companies like Facebook, Amazon.
Python is a high level language means it is easily understandable by everyone except machines (they need to convert in machine language first). Its syntax is as simple as English language in which we communicate.
TA Support- They have Teaching Assistants who will take up your query 24x7 whenever you will raise a doubt. And average time to resolve a doubt is 20 mins. They solve more than 100 doubts every hour.
the easiest way to do is to not do anything to your programs at all. Assuming that the first writes it‚Äôs output to stdout (ie uses print or sys.stdout.write) and the second uses stdin (sys.stdin.read() will work - using input might not I haven‚Äôt tested it), then you can do exactly what you need from your operating system command line without any changes.
A slightly different way to do it is to use a temporary file - let the first program write to a file and the second program reads from a file. Again the Operating system can help - in fact it can do all of the work.
If you are going to use the two programs together regularly you could integrate them. That means in your second script you write your code so that it has a clear callable interface - either a set of functions or classes. This interface doesn‚Äôt prompt for input it gets its input from function parameters that are passed. It means that instead of this code dealing with text strings from the user it is dealing with numbers, lists etc of actual Python values.
You then arrange for the first program to import the second program and maybe with a option switch you arrange for the first program to call the second one with the data, rather than formatting it as output.
If you don‚Äôt want to have the first program start the second program, then you could arrange for the second program to actively poll for output files from the first program, or use mmap and signals, or use an IPC library such as MQ. In this scenario though it is a lot more difficult for the second program to actively connect to the stdout of the first, single you have to first arrange for the first program to pass a global identifier to the first program - which means using an IPC system like shared files, or mmap and signals or IPC libraries such as MQ (and if you have already solved that problem why then try to connect to stdout).
in is a reserved word (keyword) used to test membership. Often called a membership operator.
The official documentation says, if we have x in s, this will return ‚ÄúTrue if an item of s is equal to x, else False‚Äù.
It is used to check if a value is present on a sequence or not (like lists, sets, strings, tuples, ranges). The iterables.
This AST is the compiled to The Byte codes to load the object reference onto the stack and the byte code to execute the Binary Operation. This stream of Byte codes is passed to the virtual machine.
This is because the default value for the ‚Äòend‚Äô argument is already ‚Äò\n‚Äô, so the end of the string becomes ‚Äò\n\n‚Äô which generates results in a blank line. so this is equivalent to.
Python is clever enough to know that ‚Äò\n‚Äô when written to files needs to be different depending on the operating system - for example in Windows to finish a line the O/S actually writes two characters - a CR (carriage return) followed by the LF (line feed) characters (ASCII 13 followed by ASCII 10) where as in Linux and MaxOS the end of line sequence is just LF (line feed) - ASCII 10. Python has been developed to be aware of those differences, and the end of line sequence is always presented to the use as ‚Äò\n‚Äô regardless of the Operating system - it also means that Python code which reads or writes multi-line text files in Unix and MacOs will also work on Windows and generate the same text file output and input.
t has been a convention in Python that when you call a function using keyword arguments, that the first keyword argument must come after the last positional argument. Since positional arguments must come before keywords when calling a function, it makes sense for that to be the case when functions are defined.
In the beginning, the founders of Google made the decision of ‚ÄúPython where we can, C++ where we must.‚Äù This meant that C++ was used where memory control was imperative and low latency was desired. In the other facets, Python enabled for ease of maintenance and relatively fast delivery.
Netflix uses Python in a very similar manner to Spotify, relying on the language to power its data analysis on the server side. It doesn‚Äôt just stop there, however. Netflix allows their software engineers to choose what language to code in, and have noticed a large upsurge in the number of Python applications.
I was initially confused by your reference to __new__, since __new__() is nothing to do with attribute look up - it is a special method that gets invoked before __init__() and it is responsible for actually creating the object. Clearly though the reason it is relevant as to how the __new__ is found when the storage for the instance hasn‚Äôt been created.
Implicit calls for magic methods (for instance calling __len__() from then len() function) wont even use __getattribute__() mechanism - they will just simply do a direct search in the classes __dict__().
Everything you do with pointers in other languages are simply not needed in Python, for instance everything is already a reference to an object (a reference is simply a smart pointer). All objects are heap allocated - so you don‚Äôt have the difference between local and heap allocated values that you have in other languages.
Both functions and methods do the same: they may receive an input and return and output, or do some kind of task.
In Object Oriented Programming (OOP) you organize your code in objects, which have methods.
Standard implementation of Python (CPython) pre-loads (caches) a global list of integers in the range from -5 to 256. Any time an integer is referenced in this range Python does not create new one but uses the cached version. This is known as integer interning.
String interning is the method of caching particular strings in memory as they are instantiated. The idea is that, since strings in Python are immutable objects, only one instance of a particular string is needed at a time. By storing an instantiated string in memory, any future references to that same string can be directed to refer to the singleton already in existence, instead of taking up new memory.
The problem here is that you have a single directory where you install all libraries. And all your projects will look for that directory for the libraries they need. If you update one of those libraries this will affect all your projects that needed that library.
When one learns their first programming language, one must also learn to program‚Äìthat is, not just the syntax of this new language, but why programmers use certain constructs and how and why they combine those constructs to solve problems.
I used link lists in an application in 1983 to create a sparse matrix of data to save memory over a three dimensional rectangular array when porting the application from big iron to the IBM PC XT so it could run in less than 384KB of memory.
I would say if you are really serious about learning Python and you are not just some fellow who is doing Python just for the sake of the ongoing trend, then it's time you first face an important question, what are you doing it for? Are you here to pursue Web Development, or you are interested in Machine Learning, you can even be interested in Data Analysis. If yes, then you have choosen the right language as it is one such basic language with versatile applications.
o I did some research and after confirming from my cousin at Airtel, and my seniors at Arcesium and American Express, I stumbled my boat at Coding Ninjas. Obviously I didn't welcomed the idea that much because it was paid course there but then I saw that Coding Ninjas was giving out Free Trial Course Scheme where I could complete 30% course for free to get the idea what the course was all about. So I immediately enrolled myself in Basics of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python under the Scheme and started my Classroom and I was amazed because of the Observations.
Web development refers to building a website , developing simple web pages , complex websites etc. for the internet or intranet.
According to a report , web development is one of the best career to choose , as the demand for the web developers is going to increase in the coming years . So choosing web development as the career option is a very good choice.
CodingNinjas: I personally like this website very much, it has great courses which are enough to make you Placement ready. They have launched many courses dedicated to Interview Preparation, for service and product based companies.
A named constant, folks, if you chose a clear, readable name, is a blessing for both yourself and the person or persons who will be required to read, understand, and maintain your code. It will be useful in documenting why that value is being used to control memory or execution of code.
Some of the similarities between software development and software engineering are that both deal with software and how it's made on the job. Software engineers take a more disciplined approach in many cases to how software is architected and designed. A good software engineer will do a proof of design correctness as a matter of course, folks. As a thing that I keep on saying is this: prove your code correct. This is one habit that I wish were common, since you can avoid so many problems if you do.
Learning anything in today‚Äôs digital world is not difficult . Everything from small to large things are available online nowadays. You can learn from anywhere . There are both sources available paid and free resources.
Now coming to question , language c and c++ are somewhat similar in syntax , codes structure , keywords etc. So you can start from anything depending on your choice.
Udemy , Coursera , Codacademy , Educative , Freecodcamp , and last but not the least Youtube.
You just need to search free C course in the search bar of these sites and many free courses will appear , you can choose from any of them. Same process applies for c++ programming.
Digitalization or digital era has made our lives so easier that we can learn anything online just by sitting at the comfort of your home . You just need a strong will to learn something and to finish the course , the one you are enrolled in.
Operating System (OS) is System Software that acts as an Interface between a computer User and Computer Hardware. It performs all the basic tasks like Resource Allocation, File Management, Memory Management, Process Management, Handling Input/Output, and Controlling Peripheral Devices such as Disk Drives and Printers. Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, OS/400, z/OS, etc..
With knowledge provided by a person with 10+ years of experience in that same industry you won't just be getting prepared for the interviews of companies such as AWS, CommVault, Adobe, which rely heavily on Operating System, you will be facing Industry Relevant Problem Statement for better preparedness to get yourself acquainted so much so that you will find your Journey through the Industry, smooth as well.
I'm assuming that you are looking for your rabbit hole, something that you can be passionate about and would be happy doing. CS has a number of specializations that you can explore. There are a number of things in common that are required by these fields of endeavor. One is that you need to be good at math. Another is that you need to be good at problem solving and thinking sideways, that is to say that you have to be creative and very logical as you do so. You also may find that you will enjoy challenges that you face intellectually.
Sometimes it can take a while for an opportunity to come up and show itself. With me, folks, it dawned on me that the niche for me was the result of finding my rabbit hole. I founded Correct Software back in 1986 with the dream of designing and writing GOOD CODE, code and products that were innovative, elegant and correct. There were a few people who shared my vision and a money man who decided that he could make money by investing in the company. We never really took off and the only advertising we had was word of mouth. The company closed its doors in 2010.
The UX design patterns below are organized by phase. Each pattern is color coded to show which part of the virality K-factor equation they impact (see above for key).
The context for this phase is that a user is in the process of making a decision to share content or to invite another user. The main challenges for this step are: a) getting a user to decide to share b) making it all the way through the invite process and c) increasing the number and frequency of invites.
Let me tell you the truth: you‚Äôll never be perfect in DS and algorithms, and in competitive programming in general.
As a software engineer with 3 years experience, what algorithms book do you recommend me to learn basics besides Cracking the Coding interview - which would be my 2nd to go book, if I want to prepare for a FAANG + Microsoft interview?.
Competitive programming has not developed yet to the situation we see in professional sports. That‚Äôs true that most of the top-level contestants started training in much younger age, and it makes perfect sense due to several reasons. However, starting at such age definitely shouldn‚Äôt stop you from reaching some level/achievements which are considered fine or even cool - like performing good enough for stable red color in individual rankings or winning ICPC medals in case of having a good team. I don‚Äôt have any stats about it, but I believe that number of ICPC finalists who started at age 17+ is still big even nowadays.
In simple terms, consider GitHub as a web interface for using Git. GitLab, Gogs, etc. are the other websites providing the same services as GitHub, but GitLab has been gaining much popularity after Microsoft‚Äôs recent acquisition of GitHub.
Suppose you‚Äôre working your new project with 3 of your colleagues. The planning, timeline, etc for development has been made final and now you start writing code for your project. Let‚Äôs assume you would work on back-end, two colleagues would work on UI, and last one would work on interconnecting back-end and front-end. A naive approach would be that you guys would agree before that whole code would be maintained on your laptop. Thus development is centralized to your laptop.
VCS treats each file/change as a revision and coordinates work on those change among multiple people providing information like who edited or created it, when, what changes were made, etc. It also provides the ability to revert a file/change to a previous revision for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and spamming. VCS can be distributed or centralized, but distributed has more advantages.
GitHub is web-based hosting service for Version Control using Git. It offers all functionalities of git as well adding many of its own. You get a much clean web UI providing great visuals and don‚Äôt need to master any CLI.
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, which provides a web-based graphical interface. It helps every team member to work together on the project from anywhere and makes it easy for them to collaborate.
The packages can be published privately, or within the team or publicly for the open-source community. The packages can be used or reused by downloading it from the GitHub.
GitHub provides a default website address spelled by http://username.github.io. You can use it to serve any static website or personal blog. It can handle a decent amount of traffic as well. Example: Recently Posted | Shorts by Vivek Rai.
Collaborate with other developers and work with them on the same projects.
Using Git directly : Git's a command line based tool for the most part (and that's how you get really fine tuned control). To get started, you should be familiar with the push, pull, commit, fetch, clone, add, reset commads. There's always more to learn, but with these you can easily get by.
Through an IDE : If you use an IDE like Eclipse or PyCharm or Android Studio for development, it will have Git integration built in (or can be added via plugins). You just develop your project, connect it to a Git repo (on GitHub or elsewhere) and get coding. This is my preferred method - more convenient and automated. But you should still try your hands on the first, because you need to understand what's happening under the hood, and you can't always use a fancy IDE for you programming.
You use it like everybody else does. It is primarily used for source control. In this case, cloud hosted source controlGitHub is a very versatile tool to use. It‚Äôs ideal for working on projects of any size and it‚Äôs a great tool for web work flows. Firstly you can use it for publishing your work, as a versioning control system and as a collaborative tool.
t may not be the best tool for capturing the creative process or for recording ideas. A good tool for this particular function would be LayerVault or something similar to it. We‚Äôd say Git is very good for tracking code, however it‚Äôs not the best for tracking design. It can seem a little bit of a grey area when designs are needed to be translated into code or for when you need to export designs to a production setting.
It depends on the designer, however, some find the GUI a little confusing to use and opt to use its CLI instead. Some developers learnt Git by mostly using commands, which explains why the GUI isn‚Äôt always liked by them. With a little practice, the commands are not too difficult to learn. However using Commands everyday can be awkward, especially when tracking project history or resolving conflicts. Then, there are others who‚Äôve preferred the GUI instead of commands, as the visual representation of previous commits, modified files and diffs can make better sense. As mentioned previously, it can take some getting used to.
I suggest you should focus on Git - VCS than Github - Git VCS provider. You should learn how to use Git first, having learnt about a VCS in early days will be beneficial for placements. You can install Git on your local device and maintain version of your assignments. Once you are comfortable with it may be you can setup something like Gitlab on your college hostel/lab server, where you can share codes/ebooks.
the main use of Github is to publish your open source programs, download open source programs from other people and participate in open source projects.
Machine learning is the process of enabling computer systems to perform a variety of tasks in the absence of human-provided step-by-step instructions, using analytical and statistical models. As a result, it is possible to draw several data-driven hypotheses using machine learning.
Machine learning is the process of teaching computers to learn from data in order to make choices or predictions. It is described as the branch of research that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. True machine learning requires the computer to be able to learn to recognize patterns without being specifically taught to do so. It entails the use of Artificial Intelligence to enable robots to learn a task through experience without being expressly programmed for that job. In a nutshell, machines learn without human intervention.
True machine learning requires the computer to be able to learn to recognise patterns without being specifically taught to do so. It stands at the crossroads of statistics and computer science, although it may take on many distinct guises. While machine learning has a lot of overlap with those areas, it shouldn't be grouped in with them. Machine learning, for example, is a data science tool. It is also one use of infrastructure that can manage large amounts of data.
Machine learning is in high demand all around the world. It is useful forseveral professions, like data scientists, software developers, and business analysts. Traditionally, students will spend months, if not years, learning the theory and mathematics underlying machine learning. And, I won't lie, that is the best way to begin your journey. To enter the realm of Machine Learning, one must be well-equipped with mathematics and statistics. But, it is also wise to enrol in e-learning forums so that you may receie the intermediate-level training. Courses by Simplilearn, Skillslash, Edureka etc. prove to of utmost assistance under such circumstances.
The approach can be used for tasks such as spam filtering, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). This AI-based method has also been incorporated into other applications including self-driving cars, personal assistants, and online advertising.
Automated actions, resource planning, and smarter decisions are just a few of the benefits we are looking forward to in my industry.
AI uses big analytics, machine learnings, and serval other processes to increase the insights into a specific target audience. The data collected construct a more effective and personalized customer experience throughout all touchpoints. Ultimately, machine learnings help to eliminate human error and possible guesswork throughout the customer journey.
Other machine technologies, such as Salesforce Einstein, integrates AI technologies with Salesforce software and CRM to gather data on every user, providing predictive analysis of Salesforce customers. Einstein produces advantages in marketing, helping increase conversation rates by predicting who is more or less likely to engage with an email by the terminates of an engagement score and predictive recommendations. Salesforce Einstein is assembled into four main categories, machine learning, natural language procession, Computer visions, and automatic speech recognition.
Businesses also use Virtual reality to enhance customer costs and experience. Advertisers and marketers use VR to interact with customers and build storytelling messages and relationships. VR helps business bring their audience into a virtual storefront, merging the real-world experience with digital customizations. This is the uniqueness of introducing VR to a marketing campaign, strengthen brand awareness, interest, and completeness, merging customer requests and desires into one visual platform from the comfort and ease of a specific location.
This classifier may not be 100% accurate, but such are the limitations of machine learning.
SUPERVISED LEARNING - It can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.
Email Spam and Malware Filtering- We always receive an important mail in our inbox with the important symbol and spam emails in our spam box, and the technology behind this is Machine learning.
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
As per Wikipedia, It is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
Ever seen the ads section of your Facebook profile? Or what items Amazon recommends you if you log in? Did you wonder how the recommendations seem to always be about such items that you have been wanting to buy? That is one example of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) (from my rudimentary understanding, the terms are interchangeable..
ML from what I believe is a nascent field, but growing rapidly, and finding applications in increasingly diverse areas. Companies in E-commerce, police departments, sports betting companies, etc. are increasingly hiring Machine Learning specialists to devise intelligent algorithms to enhance the predictive prowess of their systems. Some scientists had predicted that in future, machines might rule humans. Don't be surprised if that happens in this century.
Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive* amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things‚Äînumbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm.
There can also be the issue of surprising complexity. Computers struggle with many things humans take for granted. Humans provide estimates to other humans, it's not until coding begins that the computer applies its skepticism. In the response to the confusion scope creep arises.
Then I attempt to code it. When do they expire, at midnight, or the time they were provided? How do I expire them - do I write a job that continuously wakes up and expires old quotes? Do I wait for users to check for them and expire old quotes there while I make the user wait.
Outside systems/APIs - taken alone these can be fine, or even accelerate development. But any of the following will spike the cost if you aren't certain of them beforehand: No documentation, no existing happy users, no test sandbox. New systems do not get a free pass: Consider them as violating at least "No happy users.".
User preferences/Dashboards - things like "notification center" or other central settings management can quickly explode in complexity because of how many other, subject-to-change features they can touch. Often hidden by the word "graphs.".
Messaging - Constant Contact and MailChimp exist for a reason, spam filters and email verification are complex and murky subjects, while clients will often view this as "Email isn't hard.".
Position-based anything - GIS is an entire field dedicated to this subject, the Earth is far more complex than a 2D field of GPS coordinates, and positioning devices are inexact and unreliable.
High-reliability - It's common for a client to expect 100% uptime. It doesn't exist. Google promises the 5 9s (99.999% of the time in a year, the service is reasonably responsive), and they still sometimes miss that mark, despite spending literally billions on their software - including teams of brilliant very highly paid people walking around with pagers on alert 24hrs a day. What are the chances hiring one developer for a couple months can produce a system with similar reliability?.
Developers are also the only group where they are asked to do something which has never been done before, and tell someone else how long it will take before they even know what actually needs to be done.
If you have a clear problem and a clear solution in human or pseudo-human language, all you need is a Coder to code it in the appropriate computer language for you.
If you have a clear problem but don't have a solution, you can hire a Programmer to solve it and code it for you.
If you have a problem, but you know it's just the beginning of a huge series of problems and you cannot predict what's gonna happen next but you want to be as future-proof as possible, you need an Architect. Same if you are in the middle of that mess, having tens or hundreds of developers working on different stuffs and none of them care about the big picture.
Does not necessarily build an application. For example, a guy writing code to operate a mechanical arm in some factory is still a programmer, but not a developer or an engineer.
Decides which tech stack to use. i.e decisions such as desktop vs web application, NoSQL vs SQL database etc..
Makes business stakeholders understand what‚Äôs possible and what‚Äôs not.
A software developer is an experienced programmer who can design major components of a system successfully. A developer has a deep understanding of the language and platform they're working with.
A programmer is a person who can write code and make software, but often does this to someone else's system design and specifications. Programmers often lack some deeper knowledge of the language and platform they're working on.
A software engineer is a developer who can successfully think about the whole system from a system-wide architecture view to the more detailed component design and implementation and can see the effects of changes from one area of the system to another. They understand the engineering tradeoffs being made and can see the consequences of those tradeoffs.
The Stack Overflow bot: This person ran into an error, did a quick Google search and applied the first solution they found. The problem here is not that of copying from Stack Overflow. I think there are more solutions on Stack Overflow than any reference guide or manual. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful resource, if not the best. The problem is the robotic application of it without understanding the consequences. The problem is the application of it without fully understanding the context of it and whether it really applies to the current problem at hand. More often than not, I have seen people believe more of what they see on online forums than the code/system in front of them.
The I-hate-documentation: Some people believe that code documentation must be poetic and hence they lack the skill to do it, ergo not their job. In my opinion, these are the #1 foes of sustainable software. Good software is not software that provides a million cool features. Good software is one that has a few good features that are used consistently by many people and read/updated/modified by a thousand. This brand of developers who believes less in technical communication and precise and detailed documentation is the greatest weed to a company's success.
I have variables named x, flag, str, arr, etc.
Most of what I write is in one giant method.
Global variables spewed all over the place, etc.
As long as stuff works they are All right! In JavaScript the good parts by Douglas Crockford, he specifically points out that Javascript must not be used like Java. Using a new operator to create objects isn‚Äôt the JavaScript way of doing things. Writing a lot of elaborate constructs isn‚Äôt the pythonic way of doing things, but hey it works, so lets ignore all the bad practices. It works anyway!.
encounter some people at work who are stuck in a time bubble. This is a profession where stuff evolves very fast. The mark of a good programmer is to stay abreast of things. Who knows, some small tiny thing you read about can help you solve problems and get things done. For example, scalable vector graphics and icon fonts can occupy much less space and avoid unnecessary HTTP calls. If you never bothered to read about evolving technologies, you would probably be solving something very inefficiently.
I learnt the art of organizing folders and files in a project from a senior. Learn it. Watch people in GitHub do this. I mean real good people. A bad programmer has project workspaces that reeks of temp files, multiple copies, random unused directories. This is potentially a breeding ground for bugs and mindless debugging. Not taking care of naming your terminals right shows things about you. I know someone who logged into a VM and kept debugging something and changing stuff and eventually was testing it out of another VM. He spent a day and found he had a hundred terminals open. Yeah you end up looking dumb and you end up wasting a lot of time.
Bad programmers will often shoot from the hip about why certain issues are happening, without proper disciplined investigation into surgically identifying what is going wrong. They will blame other people's code, 3rd party libraries, hardware and what not else without actually pinpointing issues.
I'm going to skip over the issues that result from inexperience, because those are quickly remediable. No one was born knowing how to do this (write software, that is) and everyone writes bad code (or misuses version control, or fails to M-x delete-trailing-whitespace, or thinks Java is a good language for half a year or so) before getting to the point of reliably writing good code.
Also, most bad code isn't the result of terrible software engineers but of aggressive deadlines, poor management, and inattention to technical debt. Of course, that can create an environment in which potentially capable programmers will atrophy and become terrible over the years, and that can happen, but it's not my focus here. The point that I intend to make is that shitty code doesn't always imply bad developers. Good programmers will write bad code if they have to work to deadline.
Tepid arrogance is that of the complacent engineer who learned one, mediocre technology stack and has never felt the need to branch out. This is the Spring/Hibernate/POJO engineer who can't imagine coding in any language other than Java. He can't imagine using a database without an ORM, writing code without an IDE, or doing anything without bringing in 15 ill-conceived design patterns. These engineers aren't terribly toxic on their own-- they're -0.5x engineers rather than -10x-- but there are so many of them out there that they can dominate a company and its culture. Tepid arrogance tends to lead toward middle management in its myriad forms: architecture astronauts, "scrotum master" type roles, et cetera.
Hot arrogance is that of the "rock star" who can't work well with others, leaves scathing code reviews, and who changes APIs by the hour and doesn't bother to tell anyone because everyone else should consider themselves privileged to work with his hot-shit code. The hot arrogance pattern tends to have a manic-depressive rhythm to it: 16-hour code binges (producing buggy, undocumented code, generating a lot of technical debt but impressing middle managers by just-barely completing a lot of features) followed by 3-4 days of dead time in which the programmer is unavailable. The good news is that these engineers rarely get pulled up into management roles. The bad news is that they often end up being hard to fire on account of being the only person who understands a piece of code that the business had the bad sense to rely upon.
Quick hacks and fixes for short-term problems. Designing the right abstractions and refactoring duplicated code often require investing more of your immediate time, with bigger payouts in both maintainability and development speed in the long term for yourself and others.
Invest in learning and building tools. I've yet to meet a top engineer who didn't acquire mastery of their editor (EMACS, vi, etc), source control system, debuggers (though that's sadly going away), and programming environment. By contrast, mediocre programmers can (for example) edit code in EMACS but don't treat it like a development environment either to speed up the edit/compile/debug cycle or to reduce memory load (by off-loading knowledge of where a function is by using TAGS or some meta-search tool). Top engineers not only understand all the basic features, but usually make heavy use of the extension languages and customizability of their environment.
There are various software available that used in Civil Engineering. Civil engineering software has a range of tools which helps civil engineers in the design and construction process. This software can help in every step of the construction project including drafting & documenting, designing, visualizing & analyzing.
MS Excel is used for almost everything. Whichever profile you get into, you get to use this.
Excel: execution, surveying, planning, contracts, budgeting, designing, quality control, quantity estimation, you name it. Everyone uses MS Excel. All sort of calculation are done on it. It's easier to interpret the data or modify it as per need in Excel.
Personally, I‚Äôve spent 20 years in Emacs. It‚Äôs extensible, so it can handle practically any language or document format that‚Äôs been invented, and it has integrations like Slime (for interactive development and debugging of Common Lisp), gdb (for debugging of C/C++), MozRepl (for interactive debugging of web apps), and tonnes more. Plus, it‚Äôs extremely extensible on-the-fly and has amazing keyboard-macro powers, so I can pretty quickly throw together a ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù tool to do relatively complex tasks. Regardless of the languages I‚Äôm working in, I don‚Äôt have to learn some other tool, and I can write scripts that work in multiple contexts ‚Äútogether.‚Äù.
Right now, open in Emacs, I have: Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, Perl, Bourne Again Shell, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSCL, Markdown, YAML, plain text, Org-Mode, LaTeX, and probably some others, as well as e-mail and IRC sessions, a couple image viewers from checking ‚Äúwhich filename did that graphic have?‚Äù, various debugger and help buffers, directory/file access, Git source controls, and ‚Ä¶ probably some other things.
There are tonnes of others, many of them customized to fit a certain niche. Programming for Apple devices? You might want (or even be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to use) XCode.
The best IDE is the one that works best for you. The job of an IDE is to help you accomplish tasks, and it‚Äôs up to you to pick the one that matches your development style best.
I mostly program in a basic text editor with syntax highlighting and I avoid tools like Visual Studio because I feel like they hide a lot of complexity and when things don‚Äôt work I have a harder time figuring out why. Thus a simple text editor works great for ME.
Wars have been fought over this. Vi, Vim, Emacs, nano, Sublime, Atom, CodeBlocks, PyCharm, Visual Studio‚Ä¶. each has it‚Äôs set of fans, some of which are rabid. You need to determine what you‚Äôre looking for. This can take time AND experimentation because if you‚Äôre just starting out you might not really have figured out your style yet.
The best IDEs available these days are likely IntelliJ (by JetBrains) and Visual Studio (by Microsoft). The best text editors are likely Vim, Spacemacs, Neovim, Sublime Text, Atom, Emacs, Visual Studio Code, Brackets, and Notepad++.
Since OP did not asked for a specific OS, Platform or Language, the answer is pretty obvious: Visual Studio is far best IDE ever if you compare on all aspects.
Let's start with Bash. Now throw in tmux, so that you could have multiple screens. Now you could run Vim (my favorite) or Emacs in one screen, and run a database client in another screen. Even better, you can split one of your screens, so that in one window you can have a list of tables to the left, edit a file above, and run queries below, now go to another window, split it, then make commits in one window while you have diffs in another.
But I should provide fair warning: it can take a while to come up to speed with all these things. I've used NetBeans for a while, though, and came to appreciate the features and plugins it had to offer, but since choosing to leave it behind, I've found that everything I did in NetBeans could just as easily be done by some *nix tool, and there's probably a Vim plugin for it as well.
An Integrated Development Environment abbreviated as IDE.
It is a software application that consolidates the essential tools for computer programmers, which they used in the process of software development.
For HTML/CSS/Less/JS/Python/JSON/XML/Etc. prefer Sublime Text and Textpad (For macros).
Good old LM741 is hard to beat if your not looking for extreme performance. Cheap and easy to find. LF353 is a good choice if you want a dual. Also faster than the 741 and it‚Äôs got a FET input structure if you need that sort of thing. Most of the singles have the same pin out and so do the duals. All of these may be Googled for data sheets and sample circuits. Have fun.
When using this IC chip, please note that the chip itself DOES NOT contain a ground (GND) connection. It does contain two voltage pins, one for the plus voltage (pin 7) and one for the negative voltage (pin 4). For example, +15V and -15V. Make sure you download the datasheet.
You are now good to go. Get some cheap transistors, some diodes, and some resistor and capacitor kits, and maybe a few potentiometers (we call them pots) from the web. Marlon P. Jones (MPJA) is a good choice for cheap parts.
DevOps has became the No.1 course in the market with ‚Äún‚Äù number of opportunities in the market. There are many terms of definitions for DevOps but in simple words DevOps is a combination of both development and operations to make the workflow easier.
We can see ‚Äún‚Äù number of institutes providing DevOps courses and various other platforms which show placements word and make the students join and bluff them. That‚Äôs the place where students will be cheated and thrown back with zero knowledge. so, its better for us to research each and every institute and to step into it.
Before DevOps became a reality, IT Companies developed software employing traditional methods like Waterfall Model & Agile Methodology. Let's get a brief review of what these methods are and how they function.
Although employers may define the role differently, a good working definition of a DevOps engineer is a technical professional who follows a software development strategy that integrates development and operations.
To become a DevOps engineer, you‚Äôll need technical and interpersonal skills. This skill set can be the catalyst to breaking down the communication and operational barriers that have traditionally existed in information technology (IT) organizations ‚Äî between the development and IT operations teams as well as other functional teams ‚Äî resulting in slow software deployments that have put companies at risk of losing their competitive advantage.
DevOps engineers don‚Äôt just write code. They must also be able to implement automation tools and technologies throughout the software development life cycle. Additionally, these IT professionals are responsible for automating business processes to improve operations, in part by responding more quickly to requests for changes from customers.
DevOps engineers often work closely with software engineers to assist them in deploying various systems. DevOps engineers have a variety of responsibilities, such as implementing changes requested by customers or managerial staff, deploying updates and fixes, and in some cases, providing technical support.
Writing scripts and automation using various programming languages, such as Python, Java, and Ruby.
DevOps is a new approach to optimize and manage end-to-end service delivery and operations. It applies a set of principles to transform the entire software delivery lifecycle to introduce new practices enabled by technology.

Openshot: OpenShot Video Editor is a free and open-supply video editor for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. The venture started out in August 2008 by Jonathan Thomas, with the objective of imparting a strong, free, and friendly application to application video editors. The application supports Windows, macOS, and Linux ever due to the fact version 2.1.Zero (launched in 2016). OpenShot introduced assist for Chrome OS in version 2.6.Zero (launched in 2021). There is an unofficial portable version starting in 2020. OpenShot's center video enhancing functionality is carried out in a C++ library, libopenshot. The center audio editing is based on the JUCE library.
KineMaster: KineMaster is one of the best video editing app for android. It‚Äôs Corporation is a South Korean multimedia software program enterprise with headquarters in Seoul and branches in the United States, China and Spain. KineMaster is a publicly traded organization indexed at the Korean inventory marketplace.
I would recommend Filmora video editing software for the beginners. Because, I‚Äôm using this software for a long time, and I can say that it would be the best decision for a beginner to start the journey of video editing with this software.
Video editing can be a daunting task if you haven‚Äôt done much of it - so when choosing the right software, I suggest going with something easy and comprehensible, yet still has a decent amount of tools to work with. Write-on Video by Kdan Mobile is a good option for when it comes to editing home videos, making school presentations, YouTube videos or vlogs. What I personally like about this software is the ability to quickly make a good looking video with transitions, soundtrack and a couple of filters. It takes little time to learn how to use it, but once you do - it‚Äôs really fun. You can trim your video (cut out unnecessary shots), change the background (color or blur), add stickers and make captions, add handwriting to make certain frames pop. It‚Äôs also possible to change the speed of your clips and when you‚Äôre exporting, you can adjust the aspect ratio as well to fit the platform requirements.
If you are just learning about video editing, you may find that there are numerous software whose complexity can overwhelm you and more often than not, further confuse you rather than assisting. Furthermore, this software can cause loss of quality, and take a long time to render because of the re-encoding process of the video editor.
While Bandicut is incredibly convenient for beginners who are just learning about video editing, it also has many advanced features that are useful for professionals to edit their videos. It is easy to use without too many confusing features, delivers high-quality videos in a very short time, and allows users to share any specific clip or a merged video directly to YouTube or Vimeo.
As animation is categorized in many types, so the software products are also categorized accordingly. It totally depends on the learner that what type of animation he/she want to learn.
Technical skills: It goes without saying that any good software engineer or good software developer needs technical knowledge and technical skills. To stand out in such a market, being a full-stack programmer helps. If that makes you worry that you are expected to know every single programming language in the world, don‚Äôt fret.
Speed and productivity: It usually takes hours to decipher brittle code and patch it up. This typically comes with a steep price tag, too. We know that lines of code (SLOC, or Source Lines of Code) are not a measure but you, my friend as an enthusiast software coder should definitely cover your speed.
You‚Äôre asking the exact same question I was asking myself about a year ago. I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.
I stumbled across Udacity‚Äôs Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.
This is one of the questions I had to research when I started learning Java recently.
I quickly realized that there were 3 main ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù in this field, namely, Eclipse, IntellijIDEA and NetBeans. Although VisualStudio is quite popular as well, so let‚Äôs make it the best of 4.
IntellijIDEA ‚Äì I must admit, I did enjoy this one the most and still use it in my studies, especially since the online Java course I‚Äôm currently going through has a special plugin for this IDE. I like the look and feel of this software and the way its menus are organized. There are more than enough features in the free Community Edition, especially for a beginner. I started to customize its look even further, based on a free theme available from its Marketplace. Overall, I feel like I will stick with this one for the time being.
One is Eclipse , this is the most popular IDE. The UI is great, you can have multiple projects in the IDE's project tab. You can see the code of different project in the same window with out switching the IDE perspective. It has a different debugging perspective (view). It has a lot of plugins. This is the choice if you are a budding developer.
Second is Intellij, this is popular among a lot of hard core programmers. The UI is not as good as Eclipse but I feels its a bit quicker in processing than any other IDE. The variable values while debugging is shown right next to the them (which is great) where as in eclipse there is a separate window in Eclipse. You can evaluate expressions while debugging to check what value it is returning. The thing I don't like about Intellij is that it allows me only to load only one workspace or project at a time, if I have to switch between projects, I have to reopen the other project and wait for 30 secs for the window perspective to change. Apart form this Intellij is the BEST.
Myeclipse is a Java IDE that includes the best tools for the full stack developer. With MyEclipse, it‚Äôs simple to create a dynamic front end along with a powerful back end‚Äîthe combination that is critical to today‚Äôs enterprise.
MyEclipse delivers everything the enterprise developer needs to efficiently create powerful applications using the latest technologies.
Personally I like Eclipse, which is widely used, cross-platform and very extensible through a plugin system. The free version of IDEA I find a bit slow and Netbeans seems to be constantly trying to drag you in to Netbeans-specific stuff. But this is just my opinion.
If you are a beginner, go for Notepad. Writing programs in Notepad and running them using command prompt will give you better insights of how the things actually works using java compiler.
If you are starting to learn JAVA, I would recommend not to use any full-fledged IDE at all. IDE‚Äôs abstract out most of the basic stuff like settings of JDK/JRE, classpath, etc which are necessary to understand how JAVA works. Believe me these are basic stuffs, but very important if you really want to understand JAVA and use it for some serious, productive stuff.
Using no IDE at all has some advantages in learning a language. As everything is more complicated, you are forced to understand more details of the language and of the language environment. I guess it would be a better choice.
The top 3 IDE for Java are Netbeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ (And Android Studio if doing Android Development). I‚Äôd recommend Eclipse because Java EE development has been moved to the Eclipse Foundation. So, we may be seeing new features in Eclipse before elsewhere. But the recommendation is trivial as all 3 IDE‚Äôs will accomplish your goal of simplifying your work space and development.
The feature-rich, code-centric IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) has made Java programming easier and productive. There are many IDEs that help Java developers execute rapid web application development. Some of the notable IDEs for Java development include Eclipse, NetBeans, DrJava, JGrasp, and IntelliJ IDEA. But choosing the right one for your Java project can be quite a difficult and time-consuming task.
IntelliJ IDEA : I recently change to this as its my company standard. Cannot say much for now, but I can see that most of prestigious Java developer use this so I think you cannot go wrong with this one.
IntelliJ Idea would be best for java programming. As one of the biggest advantage I find out is , it allows to get familiar pretty much the same environment as Android Studio. So when if you are interested in android development then you‚Äôll feel very comfortable if you are used to program on intelliJ Idea.
Compiler+ is a newly launched Master compiler app, that can be used to compile over 10 programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Kotlin, PHP, Rust, Ruby, Scala, Dart, and Go.
"Best" IDE? "Best" text editor? "Best" Programming Language? You are talking about religion here. These questions are known to start wars!.
The most sensible thing to do would be to checkout a number of popular IDEs, play around with them and just pick one that suits you the best..
I have worked with Eclipse and IntelliJ. Currently Eclipse seems to be more popular though IntelliJ has some Intelligence built into it. They call it IntelliSense if I remember correctly - does stuff like code analysis, recognizes "bad" code fragments, etc..
For Java you can use Eclipse, Netbeans, Intellij as they are the most popular. If you are a beginner i would recommend you to use a simple text editor like notepad++ or sublime text and compile your programs from command prompt(for windows) or teminal(for linux).
NetBeans has a lot of good features you can use for development including breakpoints for debugging and inherent support for building web applications and many more.
The programmer realizes that the way they are thinking about programs is conceptually abstract and powerful in a way that isn't evident in the actual code being written. So the programmer thinks to themselves: "What is the core essence of the ideas I am expressing in code? And how can I represent those ideas in a way that is simpler, more succinct, and easier to see what is going on?".
According to me , the best & easiest programming language is Python. Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alik.
Pascal. I was very impressed with Pascal. The syntax was absolutely beautiful. I got very good at it. It had a fundamental flaw that many compilers allowed a work-a-around. It was first language to show the advatages and problems of strongly typed languages. The P4 and CDC compilers are very readable. They are worth the time to study.
Definitely JavaScript. It‚Äôs such a free language! You can do just about anything you want with it. It‚Äôs almost like a sandbox!.
Python: If you are a beginner you want to learn python because it is easy to learn for a beginner. Python is an open-source programming language that is used to develop Autodesk, Inkspace, 2D, and 3D animation packages and is also used for creating video games.
For web pages, database work (not a big feature of my world), cloud computing, robotics, big data, mobile phone apps, office apps, financial systems, etc, there are many and varied languages. Each language is more or less suited to the various applications. In addition, the language preferred by the individual programmer or the team in general is often going to be better for speed of development, even if it‚Äôs not necessarily the best suited to the task.
C if I had to manage memory tightly or write real-time, low-latency code. You can write performant code in Haskell or OCaml, but predictable low latency still favors C. We may see Rust moving into C's wheelhouse soon, but I don't think that it's "there" yet.
JavaScript: No doubts here. An astounding 80% of programmers claim to love JavaScript, no matter their accomplishments in it. Designed in 10 days as a replacement to Java‚Äôs bloated coding to work with the browser, named ‚ÄúJava‚ÄùScript to taunt Sun and now enjoying a well established status as a full stack language. It is so much more than just a ‚Äúweb-based language‚Äù.
Depending on what you mean by scalability (the number of developers, development velocity, runtime, multicore operation, distributed processing), the answer can be very different. And for performance scalability, it will also depend on the level of compiler support, standard linraries and runtime envornments.
Python is the language of data science and general purpose scripting. It is also fast becoming the defacto beginners language and computer science course language, as well as the common language of the maker community.
Simply put: UX is the overall experience one has with a product or service, which can include a UI. A UI is typically a combination of visual design (the look and feel) and the interaction design (how it works). UX, however, can encompass a wide range of disciplines, from industrial design to architecture to content.
o put it very simply: The UI is what people use to interact with your product, and the UX is how they feel while they do.
UX represents the User Experience design and is popularly known as the invisible or behind the scene design side. The UX design company works on design and user research, interactive design, information architecture, content strategy, usability testing, etc.
A web designer does not iterate his designs and usually concerns himself with the aesthetics of a website. He/she also knows programming languages like HTML and CSS, Scripting languages like JavaScript and PHP, web designing packages like Flash, Photoshop, etc. The Squareboat has written a concise blog on the same but quora collapsed my answers containing external links so I could not provide it here but You can copy-paste the following and google.
Perhaps this is the most tricky one which makes it often hard to explain to a layman. A User Experience Designer is the one whose responsibility is to make sure that the overall experiences of the target users while and after using the product is positive and fit close to the target's demands. UX designers create mind maps, user journeys and real world usage scenarios to stimulate how would the target users use the product to create a solution which helps the users to accomplish their goals in the best possible way. Thus, their job is to make a lot of studied assumptions for which they design the solution to test and validate.
One of the most important step of the user experience design process is to study the users whose experiences they're trying to design for. In order to do that, UX designers try to collect as information as possible about the target audiences by conducting interviews, making surveys, quantitative analysis etc. Collecting users data is an on-going process that never ends. UX designers collect and analyze the data constantly to create insights which will be the guideline for everyone else in not just the product team to make design and strategic product decision.
I think this one is closely related to UI Designer except for the part that Interaction Designer is more about understanding human behaviors. Since the job is all about the layer that contains what happen between the users and the product, Interaction Designer should know how to design the interactions on a product to be easy to understand and meaningful. The product could be anything ranges from digital products such as websites and apps to a washing machine or a pen. Interaction Designer's job is to create not just useful and functional interactions, but the interactions should be engaging as well to retain users attention and focus.
UI Design is a component of UX design. In other words, the user interface is one part of the user experience. There are many other components that play into the experience therefore UX design is a more holistic view of a product's experience from the customer's perspective.
A web designer is essentially the right person for you to develop, code, modify or debug the errors of your website created or present. He/She is responsible for the development and maintenance of your website. They work on technologies like MEAN Stack, MERN Stack, Javascript and its frameworks, design, etc. They are responsible in backend activities mainly and to some extent front-end development.
As many others have pointed out, these terms were and are in a state of flux and this evolution has hitherto only continued. Web Designer is, for lack of a better descriptor, an old term. Very few people at the heights of the tech industry use that term anymore. This is partially because it is an inaccurate description for a profession that has fragmented into areas of specialization, partially because the term comes from the early days of the web, when local HTML monkeys would grind out simple web pages for cheap. This historical baggage has devalued the term to the point where anyone who hopes to move up in their career avoids using it.
UI design is more focused than UX. Where UX can include the physical product, the copy and verbiage, shapes and colors, and branding, UI design is completely focused on a software interface. Specifically, it means the software interface for a particular use case and on a particular platform. This means the position of interaction points, and how the UI responds to user actions. This means that UI design is more closely related to information architecture than they are design. Where an information architect is concerned with information throughout the application, a UI designer is concerned with the information on an individual screen. A UX designer may may general designs for a wide variety of target screens and platforms, but a UI designer will work on the layout and patterns for a mobile phone only.
A UI Designer is someone whose job is to ensure the user interface is beautiful/tempting and intuitive ( a person can navigate easily through it without having to think too much about what they're doing). UI designers also play a pivotal role in shaping a customer's perception of a brand.
Traditional methods of measuring user experience include how long a user spends on a site, their movement through the pages, or where they drop off before purchasing. But as more and more experience goes beyond the digital‚Äîand the experience becomes the product‚Äîbusinesses will start watching more experience-based metrics to track the engagement impact, such as the positive contribution to the customer‚Äôs life.
Voice interfaces. Amazon Echo, Google Home, Cortana, Siri. These voice interfaces have all been released in slightly different formats with varying levels of success. I think 2017 will be when the big players will really dig in and either gain traction or find a different model that works for their application.
Mobile-first design is no longer a choice but an imperative ‚Äì in South Africa, 60% of the adult population own a smartphone, and just 18% own a laptop or desktop computer. Going mobile-first for design forces you to focus on the key functionality of the site and to avoid cluttering each screen.
That said, I would agree that most AI applications nowadays are indeed using or will use ML soon. On the other hand, Deep Learning, which is itself a kind of Machine Learning is becoming more an more popular and successful at different use case. However, it does not even represent a majority of the applications.
First approach is to build a set of rules/ conditions or hand made models to mimic intelligence. These rules/ models are built by humans using their experience. The machines behave like a intelligent being because of the knowledge transfer (Stockfish chess engine or Computer Vision based tracking etc).
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML. Normally in ML, one uses a simpler models and select the right features to train the model. In DL, the model is very big and it automatically learns which features to use on it‚Äôs own. For solving real world problems like self driving cars, people use all the approaches.
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. To put it simply: artificial intelligence provides computers with the ability to automatically perform tasks characteristic of human beings, such as perception, pattern recognition, and learning.
Supervised Learning: In this type of ML a computer learns from examples provided by a human expert, so that it can later generalize its knowledge ‚Äì build rules or functions ‚Äì based on those examples (supervised learning is also used in natural language processing to disentangle the underlying structure of words and phrases).
So what exactly does this mean? It means that in order for an application to qualify as AI, it has to incorporate at least some form of machine learning. However, many algorithms can be implemented using both AI and ML tactics ‚Äì depending on the individual case (there are also hybrid systems, like deep learning ). In fact, many people argue that modern deep learning would be considered artificial intelligence even though it relies heavily on neural networks and machine learning.
AI is changing. We are now recognizing that most things called "AI" in the past are nothing more than advanced programming tricks. As long as the programmer is the one supplying all the intelligence to the system by programming it in as a World Model, the system is not really an Artificial Intelligence. It's "just a program".
AI is a computer program that does something smart. It can be a pile of if-then statements or a complex statistical model. Usually, when a computer program designed by AI researchers actually succeeds at something -- like winning at chess -- many people say it's "not really intelligent", because the algorithms internals are well understood. So you could say that true AI is whatever computers can't do yet.
The "learning" part of machine learning means that ML algorithms attempt to optimize along a certain dimension, i.e. they usually try to minimize error or maximize the likelihood of their predictions being true. How does one minimize error? Well, one way is to build a framework that multiplies inputs in order to make guesses as to the inputs' nature. Different outputs/guesses are the product of the inputs and the algorithm. Usually, the initial guesses are quite wrong, and if you are lucky enough to have ground-truth labels pertaining to the input, you can measure how wrong your guesses are by contrasting them with the truth, and then use that error to modify your algorithm. That's what neural networks do. They keep on measuring the error and modifying their parameters until they can't achieve any less error.
Machine Learning implies that machines can learn on their own without being explicitly programmed. It provides a system with the ability to learn and improve from experience automatically.
There is always a conflict when these two terms come up. And yes, they are different. To begin with, Machine Learning (ML) is part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). So, AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider astute or smart whereas Machine Learning is a current application of AI-based around the idea that we should just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves. This is like Alphabet Inc. which is an umbrella of Google, YouTube, Gmail, etc. Similarly, AI is an umbrella of machine learning, reasoning, problem-solving, etc.
Artificial Intelligence, AI is a complex of various technological and scientific methods and solutions. Their use helps to create programs on the principle of the human brain. Artificial intelligence includes many tools, algorithms and systems, including machine learning. You can see a schematic explanation of the links between artificial intelligence and machine learning in the picture below. The main thing to understand is that machine learning is part of AI development.
Every field related to data science, analytics, ML(machine learning) requires maths to predict better results. This field uses algorithms and patterns to learn behaviours of machines. One should have a good foundation in maths to work in this field. Several branches of mathematics are used to decide which algorithms should be applied, what parameters to focus on, and more. There are many e-learning institutes where you can acquire mathematical knowledge, including Edx, Coursera, SimpliLearn, Learnbay, and more.
It has recently become easier to use deep learning tools such as scikit-learn, Weka, Tensorflow, and R-caret due to the availability of many easy-to-use packages. Learning from data iteratively and finding hidden insights that can be used to build intelligent applications is the foundation of Machine Learning theory, which combines statistical, probabilistic, computer science, and algorithmic aspects.
That said, I would agree that most AI applications nowadays are indeed using or will use ML soon. On the other hand, Deep Learning, which is itself a kind of Machine Learning is becoming more an more popular and successful at different use case. However, it does not even represent a majority of the applications.
Reinforcement Learning: Is a sub-type of unsupervised machine learning. In this case, instead of grouping examples into common classes, the algorithm induces a function that maps states and actions to rewards (positive or negative feedback). Reinforcement learning algorithms typically learn by trial and error.
Computer hardware are the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound card and motherboard.
Software can be defined as programmed instructions stored in the memory of flash drives of computers for execution by the processor.
Hardware is anything that is physical and part of a system: a CPU, video card, motherboard, network card, etc..
Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of code installed onto your computer's hard drive. For example, the computer monitor you are using to read this text and the mouse you are using to navigate this web page is computer hardware. The Internet browser that allowed you to visit this page and the operating system that the browser is running on is considered software.
Hardware : Mouse, monitor, keyboard, Printer, Processor, Graphics card, speakers, Webcam, headphones, Modem.
Software : operating system, 3DS Max, Maya, MS Paint, Python, anti virus, Games, web browser, Photoshop, U torrent.
Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of code installed onto your computer's hard drive. For example, the computer monitor you are using to read this text and the mouse you are using to navigate this web page are computer hardware.
Hardware is all you can handle, like your monitor, CPU, motherboard, etc. and software is a technical product with very special properties. One of the characteristics is that it is immaterial, you can‚Äôt touch it, original and copy are exactly the same etc. Examples include Photoshop, Blender, Unity 3D and more.
Hardware refers to the physical elements of a computer. This is also sometime called the machinery or the equipment of the computer. Examples of hardware in a computer are the keyboard, the monitor, the mouse and the central processing unit. ... In contrast to software, hardware is a physical entity. Alternatively referred to as main memory, primary memory, or system memory, RAM (random-access memory) is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer. RAM is usually associated with DRAM, which is a type of memory module.

As related to computing devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.), a hardware device is any equipment, internal or external, that attaches to the main device and is recognized, and/or configured by that device‚Äôs operating system. Examples are: external disk drives, video cameras, audio devices like sound cards, a pointing device like a mouse, or an external keyboard.
A laptop, a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, a car, a camera, a memory stick, a HDD, a display, etc.
I/O lets the computer talk with the world around it. Sometimes it's necessary to add functionality to a computer to keep it up to date or make it better. The amount of I/O a computer has can be changed, by adding expansion cards that support I/O. A graphics card can be added to a computer to let it talk with a display, or a WiFi card can be added, which will let a computer talk to other computers without a connecting wire. Sometimes functionality can be added through a universal port, a port that supports multiple kinds of I/O. USB, FireWire, and Thunderbolt (Types of I/O) support multiple data types. Your keyboard, mouse, and monitor all connect to a computer's I/O.

Software is usually written in a high level language (C, Java) or scripting languages (Perl, python) but needs to be reduced to a low level language (usually to assembly language first then machine code) in order to execute on hardware. This process of converting from high level to low level is known as compiling.
Software modifies the state of the hardware. While executing, the software manipulates memory addresses to modify and store data and it accesses I/O ports (Input/Output) to perform various tasks such as opening/closing removable media trays, turning LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes) on/off, transmitting/receiving data to/from remote hardware devices, etc.
Hardware can cover electronic functions that do not require software. e.g. An audio amplifiers or a linear power supplies. However, hardware can also include devices that can be loaded with digital instructions (i.e. Software) that can be executed in some sequence to perform different functions, e.g. Computers or micro-controllers. In these cases the hardware interprets and executes the software instructions. Embedded devices often have hardware interfaces so that information can be provided to the software, e.g. Analogue values or digital states and so the software can affect external devices using digital ports, digital to analogue convertors, PWMs or communication devices, e.g. UARTS, SPI or CAN. Arduino boards fall into this group of devices.
On your Arduino board, you have a micro controller. Among its other features is ability to selectively provide electricity to its pins. These pins then connect to electronic circuits. One of these circuits contains LEDs. By programming the microcontroller with computer code, you tell it when to supply electricity to the circuit containing these LEDs, which in turn manifests as software controlling the hardware as the LEDs light up.
In practice we (developers) draw a dividing line between the code we write and the things that our code controls that has a number of layers of software between us and the hardware - we just treat the whole things as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù that we send stuff to and get a response from, but we don‚Äôt care about exactly what is in the black box as long as it behaves in the way we want it to.
AMD is using chiplets and binning parts with x out of 8 cores working. Their infinity fabric connects the chiplets together to form a single packaged chip but under the hood, they can use 50% faulty chips (4 out of 8 cores pass the test program) and combine two to get an 8-core chip.
In addition, some major industrial manufacturers indicated that they anticipated needing fewer chips, and as a result, we do not currently have capacity. This part is largely a supply chain management issue. You cannot simply assume that, just because you have need, a supply exists. Foolish people look at supply and demand graphs and assume that if they have demand and cash, a supply will appear out of nowhere. Producing chips takes a long, long time.
I'm an electronics hobbyist and can purchase any semicontuctor I need. Any standard off the shelf part is available to me. So there is no shortage of standard parts. Some manufacturers want custom designed chips, meaning creating a new product with new production line. Automakets used to take 3‚Äì5 years to build the physical tooling for a new model. With robotic factories its 1‚Äì2 year. But custom silicon usually takes 1‚Äì3 year prep period. And there is a limited number of boutique fabs that make those chips. The cheaper ones are in China. Then China declared that Chinese automakers get priority over American companies. American automakers were familiar with other (metals, glass) supply chains however ignorant about semiconductor supply chains.
There isn‚Äôt. There is a shortage in the US and Europe because Trump, the stable genius, banned SMIC‚Äôs products. SMIC mostly produces 24nm chip and above. 24nm chips are used in industrial applications like cars.
Long lead-times mean that supply chain is very important as shifts have to be foreseen and accounted for, several months in advance. When anticipating major events - iPhone/Galaxy launches, holiday season, etc - production is ramped or inventories are built up ahead of time.
CPU example: Higher than expected performance from a major AMD gamble (Zen2 chiplet + ‚ÄúInfinityFabric‚Äù) reported on in November drove consumer demand beginning November 2019 which spiked mid-March with WFH. This depleted inventories and shocked prices, shocked prices drove scalper scenarios which further de-stabilized pricing.
I understand the global semiconductor (in fact, integrated circuit - IC) shortage is due to COVID impacts on supply chains and staff. Why ICs are hit so badly and for so long is perhaps the more interesting question when all the local restaurants and importers I know of seem to be back up and running OK.
Kids need Chomebooks for school and socializing, parents need PCs, everybody needs new WiFi routers with actual throughput, everybody needs phones, we‚Äôre buying tablets like they were going out of style. Because parents really, really, really, don‚Äôt need kids fighting over the TV, every household suddenly need multiple TVs in separate rooms. And headphones for everyone.
I started by using avast, they have a sound detection system that can detect malware and other infections via their behavior. But I noticed throughout the years that Avast was using very annoying marketing tactics to scare users into buying their full premium softwarep.
Currently, Windows natively has its own anti-virus Windows Defender, and it works relatively well. The majority of the popular providers have free versions of their software to test out, and they also do the job. As for anti-virus, I recommend Comodo, Avast, Avira, Bitdefender, Kaspersky or Norton. All of them proven formidable.
Antivirus is an important part of your computer as it helps to remove Virus, Malware and even provide you with a high level of security from internet bug that may be harmful to your computer so today I will recommend you with some of my favorite 10 best antivirus software that you should have on your computer. I will also feature the best and trusted buy link of all this 10 antivirus with the list so that you can easily check out or buy. so without a further delay let get started.
The worst AV you can get is McAfee or MSE/Windows Defender. I see them recommended all the time, and i can never understand why. Real World Protection Test Overview The stats say it for themselves, 17 out of 20 Av Suites SURPASS Microsoft Security Essentials AKA Windows Defender. McAfee scores BELOW MSE. When working with both of these AVs i have had terrible experiences. I had one client running MSE on his whole house, over 6 computers. A virus got on one computer, MSE failed to detect it and it spread through his whole network. When i bought a laptop it came with a free 6 months of McAfee. I still hadn't settled on an AV yet so I tried it. A month later a virus shut down the AV suite and started deleting my data. I had to uninstall McAfee and installed BitDefender, which i never had a problem with but just didn't like so i switched to Avast.
In my opinion, the future of antivirus, or any kind of malware detection of that matter, is in machine learning / AI. And as far as I know, most commercial AV solutions just aren‚Äôt there yet. The biggest problem with a more traditional signature-based approach (which can run really fast, so it is usually what‚Äôs used in AV for personal computers. There is also heuristical detection, like analyzing behavior of programs in a sandbox, but that comes with its own disadvantages as well, and usually involves a lot more overhead which makes it unsuitable for PC.), is that the AV vendors simply cannot catch up with the huge amounts of viruses appearing in the wild on a daily basis. How are you going to have a signature of a virus you haven‚Äôt seen before? If a virus just tweaks its source code (which changes the signature), how are you going to detect it? It‚Äôs a cat and mouse game that is difficult for the good guys to win.
That being said, the best antivirus for Windows is probably the one you don‚Äôt have to install or configure: Windows Defender, because it doesn‚Äôt use up resources and protects just as well as the commercial ones, especially between the free ones. For Mac and Linux, you don‚Äôt really need one if you have common sense, but you can install Malwarebytes if you want.
Each time new malware is created, a new signature needs to be created by the anti-virus vendors and then downloaded to your computer. The problem with this approach is that new malware is being created faster (sometimes every minute) than the signatures needed to detect the malware.
The hardware is more expensive, but it is so well thought out. The case is tough and beautiful. The system is light and has long battery life. The Retina display is stunning, crisp at even the highest resolution. The 16:10 screen ratio makes working on documents much easier than the standard 16:9 ratio PCs. The power supply is thoughtfully light, a detail frequently overlooked by PC makers. The power supply adds weight to your bag, too! Since PC makers often optimize for cost, they tend to use the cheaper 16:9 displays at much lower pixels per inch, bulky power supplies, and inelegant casing.
My first computers were a Ti -99/4A, and a Tandy TRS-80, (back when Radio Shack was popular). so I've been using computers for a few years. I actually used a Macintosh way back in '85, but as computers started to infiltrate the corporate world, I was basically forced to switch to Windows, which is what I used until 2008. I would notice that any computer I bought using Windows would run great in the beginning, and then would develop more and more problems as time went on, which needed to remedied by wiping the hard drive and starting over. After telling my IT director that I was ready to throw the computer out the window, he suggested that I look into a Mac, (he works on Windows). From that point on, I never went back.
Mac, I like that the software is more polished, efficient, and stable. Most apps are drag and drop, also a big plus. However, there are some glaring issues. One, reinstalling OS is a nightmare. Trying to factory reset it doesn't work half the time, and trying to download older OSes for Macs more than 5 years old is a nightmare. Second, it's a very closed environment, and just becoming more so. Access to anything but your documents and downloads folder is less intuitive until you create desktop and Finder sidebar shortcuts for your computer/HD (older versions already did this). Installing unapproved applications requires diving into the settings. There's far less available software, and less of that software is free. No pre-installed antivirus. Plus, it uses HFS+ file system, which is incompatible with most other operating systems. It also can't write to NTFS, and adding support for other file systems is a nightmare. Uninstalling software is often not straightforward, and installing/uninstalling is not consistent from app to app. And Macs can typically only receive software updates for 5‚Äì8 years before they're defunct. Try putting High Sierra on a 2011? PCs that are decades old are still running newest versions of Windows.
I currently work in a remote site and had to download several GBs of files. I moved the files to my home folder and downloaded some more. I wanted to copy the new set of files from my Downloads folder to my Home folder expecting the 2 folders to merge (as it would on Windows). I was wrong. MacOS deleted (irreversibly) the existing contents for the new ones even though they all had different filenames.
There were all sorts of issues with OS X, including not being able to save the password to the file server, having to buy all new peripherals that were Mac compatible, and the machine was in general much faster running Windows XP than when running OS X!.
I'm an Accountant and hobby Photographer/Videographer(slightly) and that's pretty much all I do using computers, apart from general Internet browsing. Read: NOT a programmer, power-user, gamer or similar. Just a regular, computer-competent 26 year old Joe.
I was a Windows-Only girl. Been faithful since windows 3.1, and before that, I was using MS-DOS. However, when it was time for me to get myself a laptop (around 2003, I think), I started to look at what the PC world was offering and it was really disappointing. I needed something small. I used to have an HP Omnibook 800, that thing was a brick and weighted a ton, but it was tiny. It was running Windows 95, had 16Mo Ram and of course I needed something a little more recent. The only PC I could find that was that tiny was a Sony Vaio, which costed about $3500. At that time, like I said, I was Windows only, I couldn‚Äôt understand people who were working on Macs, a friend of mine in high school had a Mac, I had tried it, found it awful, didn‚Äôt even give it a chance. I was really stubborn.
For all my life I've been a PC user. I had a Macbook Air for about 6 months before I spilt coffee on it and I went back to a PC. Compared to PC's there has only two things that I liked better about the Mac - the hardware was superior and the trackpad worked flawlessly. I really didn't care for the Mac OS and found the machine to be basic. When I went back to a PC I was much happier. I'm sure this is partly due to my comfort level with PC's, but it seems most of my peers moved to Mac and never looked back.
What I like about the idea of Apple in general is that their whole philosophy has been about making technology accessible to every day people. Simple does not mean dumbed down, it means streamlining things to their most essential elements. Everything from setup to backing up is made with the end user in mind, and the end user is everyone, not just tech geeks. Most people don't want to spend a lot of time tweaking and maintaining a computer, they want to get things done. I like that OS X stays out of my way.
I tried to switch the last 3 weeks ago. My background is simple: I am coming from Windows/Linux and I‚Äôm used to optimize things the way they working best for me. Windows as well as Linux supports this! MacOS as very limited options. I call it: ‚ÄúApple tells you how to use the device, you payed for it. Now go that way!‚Äù.
I‚Äôm a computer science major, so having Unix built in under the hood of macOS is a big benefit, and it has proven to be very useful. I find myself using and enjoying the terminal on macOS (I use iTerm 2) while I avoided Command Prompt and Powershell on Windows as much as possible. The Ubuntu Bash on Windows is pretty nice, but it is sectioned off from Windows and is less useful than I had hoped it would be.
Horrible feeling for me. I went to one for an iOS project, and have never used it for anything else. It leads you to where it wants you to go. Bouncing icons. The need to use keyboard tricks to do things that are easy in Windows. I truly don't get the appeal, other than the aesthetic coolness of it, which I frankly don't even find so cool.
Kernighan & Pike's elegant book "The Unix Programming Environment" may still be a good starting point. Even though it was published back in 1984, it will give you a very clear introduction to doing things at the command line and thinking in the Unix/Linux way. The authors are among the creators of Unix, and excellent teachers: their goal is "to communicate the UNIX programming philosophy.".
Latest gadgets. I heard that most VR requires DirectX. Many latest printers and webcams won‚Äôt work. Generally speaking, before buying a computer, I would do a brief googling to see if it works well with GNU/Linux.
I had a good chance to contact with computer when I was a kid (around 11 years old) and most of the time as kid, gaming on window is a part of life. Window was not very stable at that moment (3.11 and then 95), so sometimes it hanged and could not recover (by virus, broken files, ...) when I installed new games, and I got lot of trouble with my mom, because she needed the computer to do the office work. Gradually, in order to get out of the trouble, I had to fix the OS by myself (simply re-install or delete / replace the broken files so the OS can work again). This happened so many times (more than 10 re-installation per month if I remember correctly) and make me have enough patience when trying new thing. Also, installing new thing and exploring the software became my interest, even I didn't use those softwares later (cracked softwares was everywhere in my country during that time, because we didn't have internet at that moment).
If you already have operating system installed on you computer then start working basic Linux commands and make sure you understand the significance and use of each command. (e.g ls, mkdir, locate, find, ifconfig etc.).
Simply insert a usb stick into your computer and go to Google ‚ÄúLive Linux USB Installer‚Äù. This will create a bootable Linux USB stick so that you try many different versions of Linux before installing. It is very easy and really fun to try and compare operating systems before you install. Once you feel comfortable with Ubuntu, or Mint, or Elementary (all beginner friendly Linux versions) then you can just click a button that says to install if you like that version. EASY PEASY!!!.
Start by downloading a distribution. Many people start with Ubuntu, which "just works", or with Linux Mint, which is basically Ubuntu with an interface that is more similar to Windows 7. Other distributions are just as good, but Ubuntu has a wider user base so it's easier to find answers to your questions on line.
Now install Linux Mint/Elementary OS/Zorin OS after downloading the ISO image & burning it in a CD/DVD/USB. Only thing you need to know is if you are dual booting & want to keep your data safe(without formatting), is selecting the partitioning, choosing the mount point, swap area. Just crawl the web for that. Else just normally insert the CD/DVD/USB it & follow the instructions.
Once you have decided on the flavor you want to use, you can now decide how you wish to use it. For extreme greenhorns I suggest using a virtual machine to see the basics of Linux. In a virtual machine you will be able to tinker with anything you like, without any risk of hurting your main OS. You could also put your desired flavor alongside your main OS and choose which one to boot into each startup, this is called a dual boot. I only suggest putting going Linux full time if you have used it for over a month and you don't depend on that machine/OS. An important thing to remember when considering an OS swap is which programs you rely on, and if there are similar programs. This is when a dual boot comes in especially handy, switching between the two operating systems when you need the different programs. An example of this "program barrier" is gaming: out of my 130 Steam games only 59 run on Linux. Some people have mentioned using WINE (designed to run Windows programs on a Linux machine) but I see this as counterproductive. If I wanted to run Windows programs, I would use Windows. And thus, Windows is on my gaming desktop.
Everything from software installation to hardware drivers works differently on Linux, though, which can be daunting. Take heart‚Äîyou don‚Äôt even need to install Linux on your PC to get started. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know.
It's pretty easy to create a VM on Windows to create a virtual environment to run Linux in. VMs are easy to manage, and when you're done using them, you can delete them. You can even back up copies of the entire virtualized (guest) operating system if you need to.
Ubuntu 16.04's Unity desktop can be quirky, but it‚Äôs packed with useful features you‚Äôd never find on your own, like the HUD. If you're going with Ubuntu 16.04 or earlier, be aware that Ubuntu will be abandoning its Unity desktop in future versions. Ubuntu dropped Unity in favor of the GNOME shellthat comes default on Fedora and other distributions. If you want to try Ubuntu, we recommend trying Ubuntu GNOME, which uses the GNOME desktop instead of Unity.
All you have to do is buy a computer and install most widely used distribution of linux (that is Ubuntu). Google it and you will find that installing ubnutu is really simple. After you have set up your system, try usual things like opening a directory(called folder in windows) and reading/ writing files using terminal( terminal looks similar to command prompt). Facing any difficulty ‚Äî> ask google.
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúfix‚Äù distro which software companies use. At the base, most things are the same and you can pretty much make any Linux distro to suit your needs. As an example, be it Ubuntu or Fedora or Arch, you can run the same ‚Äúls‚Äù command to list files in your directories, and same goes with big software systems. At the base, they all use the common C and other libraries.
learn how linux is structured (filesystem, permissions, etc.), for system administration (desktop, server). Tutorials are a good go-to solution, but honestly, I would recommend looking into decent linux sysadmin books first. I can‚Äôt recommend any outstanding one, since I‚Äôm not a sysadmin myself, but try to get one used from the O‚ÄôReilly series.
If you‚Äôre already familiar with computers and programming, you should have no problem. If you‚Äôre not, though, don‚Äôt give up. Try to set yourself realistic goals: you can‚Äôt learn ALL that linux can do, you need to set yourself some target that meets your needs. I mean, I‚Äôve been using linux for more than 20 years, now, I ditched windows completely 12 years ago (it was more of a nuisance than anything else), but I‚Äôm not going to learn how linux manages network connections, or X11 servers, or other very technical stuff. I just need to process text, audio and video, to get things done when I develop my own programs, to access the web, read my messages, to print stuff I‚Äôve written (using latex or libreoffice), and be able to use common hardware (eg. possibly old keyboards, input devices both new and old, etc.) without going crazy (that used to happen a lot with windows). I don‚Äôt play videogames, so I‚Äôm not messing with Nvidia drivers etc.
If currently you are using a windows OS then I‚Äôll suggest you to use a virtual linux OS inside your current windows OS using softwares like VMware Player, Oracle Virtual Box etc. Although there would be a slight degradation in the graphical interface but that would be sufficient enough for learning basics (Its quite easy as nowadays Linux too offers a good userfriendly GUI and it is not just about learning bash codes). After you become familier with such basics , I suggest you to get a fresh OS of Linux or if you wish you may use dual boot( If its important for you to work in windows as well ). Slowly shift yourself to linux (At first it might seem a little difficult) and you will continue to find yourself more comfortable with it.
My journey started with a simple problem (now strength) which i faced in windows. The name of problem is ‚ÄúCustomisation‚Äù . Yes, you read that right. Customisation is a huge problem in Windows operating system.Although many people find it easy to change registry in Windows but it was cruelsome for me as all of them looked overwhelming and cryptic at same time. Moreover regular Windows updates increased my problems. So my solution was Linux (MINT) .Yes ,I started out with Linux Mint and till now I have tried several Linux based OS (Ubuntu,Fedora,RHEL,Elementary).
If you plan to market your Linux skills, then it doesn't matter so much which version you install, since much of your time will be spent behind the GUI tinkering with the command-line, and this should be (fairly) standard across the different versions.
If you're looking to go into application development or some kind of higher-level software team, or even server administration like me, you don't want to learn pure Linux, you want to learn how to use Linux in a practical sense. Go install some kind of Linux Distro, like Mint, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, or something of which there are hundreds.
Install it. Delete OSX, delete Windows. Everything you can do in those operating systems you can do in Linux. Best way to learn is jumping in head first. All the information is out there on the web, you just need the right motivation to go looking for it. Have you ever seen that episode of Friends where Rachel was wanting a new job, so Joey told her she needed to quit her old job first in order to have "the fear"? That's what you need. Just jump in and go. It's not hard.
If you have been using Windows for quiet some time and you are comfortable accomplishing your tasks on windows then you can start by replication.
If you can create a folder in windows, learn how to create a folder in Linux. If you can see a folder in windows, try to browse and look up at the files and folders in Linux.
You might wonder if its going to work. Believe me, if you can understand the output "ls -l", you at least some to know about some very important aspects in Linux i.e permissions, if it a folder or normal file or special file, does it have hardlinks, is it a softlink to some other folder, its owner, its group and so many other details.
Install Ubuntu and run it for a few days. It's just an OS. Everything you need is in a dock down the left side of your screen. You don't need to go to the command line although eventually you'll find that it's a convenience. Don't worry, you won't break it. It's tremendously stable. In fact, Linux installs can literally last for years with no maintenance whatsoever. Before it was a desktop OS it was a server OS that could take pounding by millions of hits a day. It's not Windows.
You see, not everybody who uses Linux wants to be a programmer, a superuser or a systems administrator. It's a shocking idea to some, but it is true. I for example, have spent at least 10 happy years being none of these things. I am technically minded, I did work as tech support, but not primarily as an administrator or programmer. I have just started learning programming, because I found a problem interesting enough to get me on my way.
The easy explanation: Linux is an operating system just like windows and mac. Windows is the most popular OS, so popular that people have started associating and interchanging the the terms 'PC' and 'Windows'. Linux and Mac are renowned for their speed and security. You will be hard pressed to find viruses, malware, etc on Linux and Mac. I think this has got to do with their low popularity rather than their capability to withstand attacks. To sum it up, here are the advantages that Linux has over Windows.
Compatibility: Linux is compatible. Period. You can run linux on almost everything : ARM, i386 , x86, etc. You can even run linux in washing machines, kindles, etc(More on that later).
I use Kubuntu because I prefer the KDE environment. KDE has a task bar, a 'start menu' called 'Kicker' and a desktop folder where shortcuts can be placed. KDE has a lot more too but that's all you need to know when first starting out.
I recommend that you keep your Windows and make a dual boot with Ubuntu. Since users don't know what they can do on Linux you can always return to Windows with no problems. When you feel comfortable with Linux, then completely remove Windows from your hard drive and enjoy.
What is Linux or GNU‚Äôs Linux?.
Everyone has heard about it, some might say android is Linux, some people think there are two Operating Systems, one Windows and other Linux, guys from Computer background generally think Linux is an Operating system, which is used to run servers, and is quite secure.
I switched 5 years ago. It cost some work and even a few frustrating crashes/hangups but it was just part of the learning experience. From Ubuntu to Archlinux, my 5 year old laptops have never been faster or easier to use. I can do just everything I want and if I want to learn it the answer is easily Googled or had from the community (user forums). My answer to your question: Don't expect another Windows, it's a completely different OS with a spectacular set of options but you have the controls and you need to master it. Windows takes the control from you and limits your options. Patience and you will be rewarded!.
Well first the recommendations: go for ubuntu derivative as they have most of packages available and are quite desktop oriented distros. I would throw Linux Mint and http://elementaryos.org. Secondly, keep in mind that you are coming to completely different OS so everything may not be as easy at first .... have patience.
As an example when I first started my network card didn't support Linux so I couldn't get online. The lead developer of the distro wrote to me and told me to visit a local computer store and buy a $5 add-in network card. I did, and it worked. I got online and have never looked back.
Make bootable LIVE DVD or USB flash images, and boot your system, and spend at least 4 hours with each one, not all at once perhaps, but mainly to get a feel for how each one differs. They are the same Linux distribution, but the Taskbars, and the level of customization, and how things install are what you need to consider.
interesting a machine to run linux - how is that different to a machine that will run windows? To dive into something new simply because you dislike what you have is, in my view, a naive strategy. At the very least you should try using different linux distributions (hate the word distro) and ideally do this by setting up a dual boot system. Live CD's and Virtual machines simply do not give you a real feel for something. When you have run a system alongside windows for a while you may decide you like it better in which case you can commit - or with a large enough hard drive why not keep both systems for the odd times you need windows to run something linux wont (or vice versa) embrace change and explore by all means but dont dive into the pool until you know you can swim!.
EDX has a course on Linux coming up. It looks like it may be very helpful. If there are Windows apps you must run then VertualBox, and Wine may be worth learning about. If you can do without Windows apps you can save a lot of trouble. Streaming services like Spotify are a good alternative to iTunes. iTunes only works in Linux under VirtualBox. The only way I've been able to get education toys like those from LeapFrog to work is using VirtualBox. VirtualBox requires a copy of Windows. Wine will run windows apps without Windows, but need Linux device drivers for usb connected device like iPods and LeapFrog devices. The last time I looked these did not exist.
On the positive side even running Windows occasionally under VirtualBox is not nearly as painful as depending on it all the time.
If you change to Linux you will shortly find that this has been your best decision since you bought your first PC. Just take some easy distro as Zorin OS or Peppermint and you will have up everything in less than 20 minutes. No need for virus protection anymore. No need for periodical cleaning and re-installation. Tens of thousands of software available using 'Software Center' where you can download and install your programs safely. Even most software you have earlier been using will be available using wine or virtuabox. If you are stuck somewhere, you will find help contacting large communities or simply seaching for a solution in your browser.
To be honest, from a user standpoint, not much difference. With the exception of some software that you use on Windows(like MS Office) will instead be replaced with open source variants(LibreOffice). Some stuff is more difficult to install, but if you're patient to get stuff working it's very rewarding. In my examples I'll use Ubuntu.
The major differences are that GNU/Linux is made with much more sense than Windows, which will bring you peace of mind. One user is very unlikely to mess up the stuff of another user. And the system will always ask you to authenticate yourself (type in your password) when you're doing something tricky. So you'll always feel safe clicking around until there's a password prompt. Installing programs is different and way simpler. And the rest is just minor stuff you'll learn by yourself.
Security - linux essentially only has two levels, god and pleb, acls exist but you have to install the module and they only apply to files, nothing else. There simply isn't any concept of granting someone the right to modify a printer setting. You can also destroy your system by accidently leaning on the keyboard (joke) - shell commands are short, powerful and generally don't ask you if you are sure. I love command line but linux (and unix in general) suffers from command-itis - theres an exe for *everything*, sometimes multiple exes to do the same thing in different ways. Windows has the same but theres more of a tendancy to have a single exe to do everything related to an area, like the net or netsh tools.
Linux can be easy but you are your own administrator. There are nice and mean linux users. Maintaining a Linux box securely requires effort. We are not here to hold on to your hand but if you are truly trying, help is out there. Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI got an error message from bash‚Äù, be extremely descriptive. Take some online classes to use the terminal. Don‚Äôt just reuse someone else command lines, use the man pages and online help to understand.
The beauty of Linux is that it offers you great power to do what you want -- including running Windows apps. I strongly recommend Oracle VM VirtualBox, because it is easy to install and set up, and it has a "Seamless Mode" that will integrate the Windows desktop with Linux. Great for those programs that don't have a good Linux equivalent yet. It's also a great way to play around with different Linux distros as well.
The free software community thrives on a strong spirit of volunteerism. If you engage sincerely and graciously with the Linux community, you'll find a lot of enthusiastic and competent people willing to help you, sometimes for hours at once or over the course of weeks, whether that means answering your question or just helping you understand problems and solutions that come up along the way.
Use a ‚ÄúLive CD/USB‚Äù installer, and try Ubuntu before installing. Assuming your computer is compatible, you should be able to install Ubuntu (the most popular Linux distribution) in less that an hour (usually about 30 minutes). In most cases, that‚Äôs it! You should have a completely working and ready-to-use PC. Office software is included and installed. However‚Ä¶.
The installation is quite tough, formatting and arranging then adding codes in terminal that‚Äôs really awesome. And it‚Äôs boot time is very impressive. In windows you have to wait for loading and all. But here, Click and Go.
Okay, so Linux, Unix, Windows XP‚Ä¶ Put simply they are all starting to merge into the same fundamental OS. Yes, there is virtually no concept of root in Windows, even as administrator. Yes, all input and output devices are treated like files. What I recommend, to anyone trying to transition from Windows to Linux is‚Ä¶ take it nice and easy‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt go all Command Line Interface. Start out with a Distro like Ubuntu. Which is essentially windows without all the windows crap and Linux is really just the Command Prompt. For now‚Ä¶ eventually, you‚Äôll actually have to explore things beyond a GUI‚Ä¶ and honestly you‚Äôll find yourself doing a lot of stuff a lot faster. To make it fun I and easy you only need run two commands once Ubuntu kindly walks you through it‚Äôs installation process.
Ubuntu is a great OS to run, and i will list those reasons below, however there are somethings i miss about the windows OS. If the things that i miss aren't important to you, or can be overcome, i would highly recommend Ubuntu. If there are some things you can't live without that are windows only, i would setup a dual boot system, which is what i use.I can run either Ubuntu or Windows on the same computer.
It's really dificult to give a user-perspective explanation of "Linux" if you don't go into the command-line tools. And I'm guessing you're not familiar with command line too much - coming from Windows. The reason is not that Linux is useless without the CLI (Command Line Interface), but because that's the only real common thing between any two Linux variants.
I mean that it depends on your works and what softwares do you need. If you use photoshop or Office a lot don't switch to linux because their alternatives are not that much good. I switched to Mac because I need Xcode which only have OS X version. If someone need to work with visual Studio they need Windows. If someone need some softwares or packages that are only available in linux(which I don't think there is such a thing at all) they should use linux.
Security ‚Äì In line with the costs, the security aspect of Linux is much stronger than that of Windows. Why should you have to spend extra money for virus protection software? The Linux operating system has been around since the early nineties and has managed to stay secure in the realm of widespread viruses, spyware and adware for all these years. Sure, the argument of the Linux desktop not being as widely used is a factor as to why there are no viruses. My rebuttle is that the Linux operating system is open source and if there were a widespread Linux virus released today, there would be hundreds of patches released tomorrow, either by ordinary people that use the operating system or by the distribution maintainers. We wouldn‚Äôt need to wait for a patch from a single company like we do with Windows.
Software engineering/IT/Web‚Äîyou‚Äôre better off sticking with Debian, Ubuntu, or RedHat/CentOS if you want to use the computer to write your own software and/or manage commonly-used platforms without constantly tweaking with the guts of it.
Arch Linux defines simplicity as without unnecessary additions, modifications, or complications, and provides a lightweight UNIX-like base structure that allows an individual user to shape the system according to their own needs. In short: an elegant, minimalist approach.
Secondly, I‚Äôve explained many times, what Linux is and does. Linux is a kernel and all Linux distributions use it. Hence LINUX distributions. Meaning, there is no one-fits-all lighter, faster, better or better looking. Linux distributions are not fixed and final operating systems and they are not like Windows. Linux distributions are modular sets of tools that cater to individual purposes, taste and working styles. The whole point is, to find the one that‚Äôs closest to your individual needs and to adjust it to your individual purpose to MAKE it the best, the fastest, the lightest, the most productive and efficient for YOUR INDIVIDUAL PURPOSE! I‚Äôve said that many times at this point.
Yes, you can use WhatsApp both on your phone and laptop. WhatsApp has a built in feature call WhatsApp Web that allows you to chat with your phone and laptop.
But the disadvantage of the feature is that if you find your laptop in the hands of wrong people, they could read your messages and write ones as well when ever your phone is online and if only you forget to logout from the laptop. The relief also is that if you found out you forgot to logout from the laptop, you can also logout all connected computers using the phone. NB: Not all smartphones support that feature, only Android, BlackBerry and Windows phone support it. iPhone does not support it the last time I checked.
Launch WhatsApp on your phone and access the settings menu (click the three dots at the top right to access more options on an Android device), then choose WhatsApp Web. A QR reader will then open on your phone, point this at your PC screen to read the code and be automatically logged intoWhatsApp on the web.
Type WhatsApp web in ur pc browser, then u see a qr code on ur screen,now go to ur WhatsApp in phone then click on three dots present on right top,and u see what's app web there,click on it and u see a scanner,scan the PC qr code with ur phone,and it opens in PC.,both mobile and PC Shouldmust have internet connection.
If the installed Linux distro of the said PC is ‚Äúdebian-based‚Äù or ‚Äúrpm-based‚Äù, you can download it and after which use a package manager for automatic installation. The second option, is manual installation through CLI using the command ‚Äúdpkg‚Äù. If the Linux distro is not debian-based nor rpm based, then there is a huge probability that you will have to download its source code, compiled it before you can manually install it.
In order to install WhatsApp and have it actively running on your PC or laptop, you need to download Bluestacks, an Android app player. The software is nothing but an Android emulator for Windows or Mac operating systems.
I've seen a feature on Whatsapp called Whatsapp Web. All you do is select whatsapp web on your phone then allow your phone to scan a barcode from a website on your computer and then you can use Whatsapp in your browser.
Search for "bluestacks" on internet.... Its a software freely available on internet and it lets you run every android app on your computer. You can enjoy, not only whatsapp, but any android app on your PC. But beware, its a very "heavy" software, because it uses very high numbers of resources (memory, ram, rom) on your computer. But no harm in trying it once.
Via BlueStacks, which is an Android emulator. For Linux, its GenyMotion. Also, you may use whatsapp web but for that you'll need Google chrome browser installed and your smartphone to be connected to the internet. Then you can visit https://web.whatsapp.com and scan the QR code from whatsapp installed in your device and voila you're ready to chat.
Yes you can install whatsapp on you PC. All you have to do is to download software named "Bluestacks". But in order to install bluestacks your PC must need RAM of 2gb otherwise it won't run smoothly and if you're using Windows 10 then there's goanna be no issue but in case of windows 8 there are some problem. Because of some bugs problem in windows 8 your PC would not allow you to install bluestacks, but this is not a problem in case of windows 8.1. So I suggest if you're using Windows 8 then might need to upgrade your windows and I can assure you that windows 8.1 is much better than 8.0.
I think you can use whatsapp on laptop as well as in your phone(not required your phone connected to wifi or not), you need to install Android emulator on your PC and then install whatsapp through it. By this way you can use Whatsapp on your pc as well as in your phone. (Bluestack is one of the Android emulator).
I have come to appreciate how beneficial it is to have a PC that is very cool and quiet. For me, my dual-core mobile i3 with a SSD boot drive has been a very reliable daily-driver for over four years. It does everything I need it to do.
Its kind of impossible to say a computer as best desktop computer unless you know a few things. What makes it best are the components and configuration that is in the computer. Generally a prebuilt computer dont have all the best components. I mean some components can be good but not all. To get the best components, you have to build it yourself. And to do that, you should know what is your purpose for having a computer, and accordingly you choose and invest in components - thats first thing. Secondly, getting all the best thing may not be good enough, you should know how to configure them. By configuration I mean.. You should know that all the components that you bought are best suited for each other. Supposedly you got the best or high end intel i3 processor and you got the best gtx 1080ti graphic card. These two components are good but are not best to work together. i3 processor is good for daily low intensive work such as videos, music, ms office etc. and for doing such kind of work you dont need 1080ti gpu, integrated gpu is good enough. Putting a 1080ti to work with i3 is bad configuration and wastage of money. Or putting it otherwise.. You do heavy graphical work and games.. i3 is weak for that and will not allow gtx1080 to work at its full capability. Thats a bad configuration even though both the components are best in their class.
You can compare specs and features and brands but when you sit down to use the computer, there is nothing like a Surface Studio. The natural feel of using the stylus and precision of both pointer and colors makes this a standout for drawing and graphics editing. The speed and responsiveness are that of the a top of the line PC. The only thing better than this will be the next generation with the i8 processors.
In terms of brands, I myself will always prefer desktops that I built myself. It allows for much more flexibility and upgradability, and it‚Äôs just fun to build. For laptops, I have a special place in my heart for Lenovo ThinkPads, due to their keyboards, build quality, support, and Linux compatibility. Though my next laptop may end up being a Surface due to the flexibility of having a proper tablet with an active pen running a full desktop OS.
You don‚Äôt need 2 all-in-one CPU coolers. And you won‚Äôt be able to run the majority of games in 4k at 60fps on RTX2060 Super or not, you need either 2 1080Ti‚Äôs for that or a single RTX 2080ti. For the CPU go with AMD if you want to stream you‚Äôll need extra cores and AMD offers more cores per dollar than Intel. Don‚Äôt dump your money into a high end motherboard unless you are overclocking and if you are overclocking, again, go with AMD Ryzen 3xxx are more overclock friendly than Intel chips. NEVER buy a 5400 rpm drive, get an NVMe or if you are on a budget a SATA SSD. Since you are doing a full water loop don‚Äôt get a glass corsair case they look good, but the air flow is average at best, unless you go with 1000d the thing is so big it has it‚Äôs own weather system. So the short answer to your question is hell no.
Apple/Macintosh - The prices are exuberant, the processing capabilities are (usually) worst out there in price-to-performance comparisons, and video games? HA! You‚Äôre lucky if the games even have a Mac/iOS version! And even then, you‚Äôre probably not equipped to play more than Minecraft. But aside from all of that, it‚Äôs a literal plug-and-play computer. Plug it in, turn it on, account setup for a few seconds, and done! You‚Äôre back to whatever you were doing before. Repairs are done by professionals, so it‚Äôs rarely your fault if something breaks. Just be ready to pay a pretty penny for the repair service.
This from Apple ‚Äì a brand which really does dominate the top-end of the market ‚Äì is pricey but includes the brilliant Touch Bar. This means the top row of function keys is replaced with a thin touchscreen where the keys can be customised for the application in use. It‚Äôs a spectacular and useful way to make a laptop even more convenient to use. Beyond that, this is a super-slim, lightweight machine with a huge trackpad and a keyboard which is among the most comfortable available. The 13-inch display (15-inch models are available too) is high-resolution and vividly colourful. It also has a fingerprint sensor built into the power button, so signing in or validating online purchases are speedy operations. If you don‚Äôt fancy the Touch Bar, there are new MacBook Pro models available from ¬£1,449 and older models from ¬£1,249.
just kidding, theres no real best computer brand, for the most part prebuilt computers tend to not even have the same brand parts inside ( ie, Dell computers using Foxconn or Zotac and msi parts. ) so going for the brand on the front is 100% pointless, you have to choose the individual hardware to get a actual decent computer. that being said different companys tend to do better in differnet departments. Asus is known pretty well for monitors and graphics cards, whil they also have a reputation for motherboards that arrive at your door dead on arrival.
So if you want to use the computer for hard core gaming, a system with high performance GPU and fast CPU would be better. If you want it for general purpose or office work, any system with moderate configurations will do. If you want to create a high traffic web server you need a system with fast CPU and big size RAM with good Network Card. Or if you just want it for minor computations in some project, even a raspberry pi could prove itself best for the task.
Moore's law states that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year. As of 2018, the size is 5nm. The Silicon‚Äôs atomic size is about 0.2 nm. Shrinking to the extent can be done upto this level. Below this we would enter into atomic level. Here in that quantum world, our classical physics never holds. Quantum physics enters. The electrons possess different characteristics and behavior in quantum state than we observe in real world. Some are superposition, entanglement and so on. Thus the introduction of QUANTUM COMPUTING. Quantum computers are best computer as of now.Such a computer is different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Any cryptographic arithmetic can be broken in a fraction of a second. The fastest computer can be achieved.
I used to think that MSI was near the top of the heap because for many of their products, they are the creator/supplier of the components, not just the assembler. But then of the PCs I have assembled myself, it was only one with an MSI motherboard that failed early. All of the rest have had ASUS motherboards, with no failures. Call that ‚Äòthe luck of the draw'.
That is, in January of 2017 the new supercomputer from China it has topped the latest list of the world's most powerful machines. The 93 petaflop Sunway TaihuLight is installed at the National Supercomputing Centre in Wuxi. At its peak, the computer can perform around 93,000 trillion calculations per second.
Thin and light with a battery life that exceeds 7 hours, it has managed to squeeze a 13.3-inch screen into an 11-inch frame, proving the nigh-border less Infinity Edge display to be a design marvel. Outfitted with Intel‚Äôs latest Kaby Lake processors and lightning-fast storage and memory, the Dell XPS 13 is dressed to impress with welcome addition of a Rose Gold color option as well. It should comes as no surprise, then, that we still rank it as the best Ultrabook and best laptop overall. Have a try! Of course, best computer should goes with best program to maintain it. Here I recommend Wise Care 365 which can make it run as fast as new.
All brands in the market are pretty good.Choose your lap as per your requirement.If you are casual user go for i3 or i5,if you are passionate about gaming go for 7 series(dell),if you are developer of swift go for mackbook(mac is l‚Äôll better then other companies in market).If you are andriod or software developer go for i7(any company) with minimum of 8GB RAM,if you take my opinion go for dell because its hardware portion is fantastic.
It actually depends on what work you want a pc for. If you want a pc for gaming, then I suggest you to buy a pc with a good graphic card. If you want it for video editing then you should go for a pc with more and faster ram as you would actually benefit from the faster speed and also a pc with an ssd would be recommend as it will increase your rear and write speeds by a huge margin compared to traditional hard disks. If you want a pc just for watching videos and browsing the internet I suggest you go for a cheaper pc and spend the extra money on a faster internet connection.
Most recommended for what ? Corporate, personal, gaming, collage, media production, or daily use? The two I would recommend would be the ThinkPad line under Lenovo for durability, expandability, and all around workhorse of a computer. For personal daily use I would recommend a MacBook Pro, preferably the 15 inch one with the HK i7. They can run Windows natively through Bootcamp so you could have both on there if you wanted . If gaming then Alienware or MSI , they are the best of the consumer gaming laptops and know their stuff for gamers.
The best PC there, by quite some margin, is a Core I9-9980XE with a RTX 2080ti GPU, 64GB RAM, MEG X299 motherboard, and an Intel Optane ‚Äúsupercharged" 480GB SSD, running Windows 10 Professional.
I have several computers here and right now I‚Äôm working on a circuit and PCB design for device that connects a Raspberry Pi to the CAN bus found in newer cars and many industrial applications. I‚Äôm using a 27‚Ä≥ iMac. I like the screen space and the fact that I don‚Äôt have to deal with MS Windows. And the seamless integration between my iPhone and iPad.
If you prefer gaming and have some decent cash to spare, go for Maingear PC, Alienware or Digital Storm gaming PCs‚Äô. If you however want a regular work/media PC, any thing like a Dell or Lenovo or HP would do best. If you are into PC builds, go grab some PC parts and build your own. Its a bit cheaper.
I personally think you should build your own pc. It's cheaper, really fun, can be better fitted in your budget and you can choose which parts you need to be stronger, but if you're scared of breaking something. I would go for an NZXT BLD they are pretty worth the money and you can choose which games you want to run, it shows you multiple models at different price ranges. I love the look of the cases. I wouldn't go for an Alienware as you pretty much pay so much just for the case. But it's up to you.
The other major change is that the graphics were previously Nvidia Pascal GTX 1080Ti and are now Nvidia RTX. Typically these would be RTX Titan, although the system in our video is equipped with RTX 2080 Ti graphics.
As PC hardware continues to speed up, so does software, and Windows 10 is no exception. This is especially true of startup time: If you upgrade from Windows 7 or earlier, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how fast your machine is ready for action. There are other performance factors to consider after you're up and running, however. Even the latest, shiniest Windows version isn't immune to slowdowns.The problem with a lot of Windows speedup stories is that they tell you to turn off some of the operating system's more-fun features, such as visual animations.
Computers slow down for any number of reasons, but most of those come down to one thing ‚Äì how we're using them. On a daily basis, we download programs, install extensions, install software, surf the web, create files, save files and fill your hard drive with data, inevitably building up virtual detritus that will impact your PC‚Äôs performance.
Antivirus like Kaspersky, Mcafee consumes high memory which makes computer slow. And when they expires then they become Trojan virus which makes computer much slower. So, if you have expired antivirus installed on your computer then go and uninstall it right now.
Off topic story: At my old company we were building a 972 node linux cluster, and the boss asked how long it would take to boot. We (the software guys) said 5 minutes. 18 months later when the chip was baked, we found out a shift register was wired backwards and we had to bit-bang the initial load of the software. After much work we got all nodes booted and running in 7 minutes. This was treated with great hilarity by the rest of the company, but in fact most other clusters of that size would take an hour or two. Then in turned out the hardware and software was extremely reliable and customers reported uptimes of over a year. It hardly mattered that that a restart would take 5 minutes or 7 minutes or an hour, for that matter.
The first step in making a computer faster is to identify where the bottlenecks are which are slowing things down. There is an old saying that ‚Äúall CPUs wait at the same speed.‚Äù What it means is, if the CPU is waiting for something else, upgrading to a faster CPU will still leave the CPU waiting. This really applies to every part of the computer. If the CPU is spending most of its time waiting for data to be read from the disk, a faster CPU will spend just as much time waiting for the slow disk. If the disk is idle most of the time, waiting for data from the network, a faster disk will still be waiting for the network. And so on it goes.
Your computer might have slowed down due to its storage being full, delete all the items you don't need and if you feel that all you have seems to be important I would recommend you to buy a Hard disk and shift your important stuff.
There are many options, mostly depend on why the computer slowed down. If you have a decent rig, built not so long ago, you probably have software issues - you need to do some decluttering, checking for viruses and trackers, etc. Also possibly you need some RAM upgrade - most of the prebuilt systems come with one single stick RAM - if you buy an other one and make it run as dual channel, it can speed things up considerably.
Stop all unneeded background processes. Look at the right corner of your Task-bar, to the left of the time, date and essential system icons. You will see a group of small icons, collectively called the 'notification area' or 'system tray'. Each of these icons represent a program that has been at least partially started or is running "in the background". Regardless of state, each causes a reduction of available memory and processing power, or resources. Closing, exiting or canceling any unused background process returns those resources to the system, and becomes available for use by the application(s) started specifically by the user. Go to your task manager and click on the Process tab. End all process that you can.
Since then, the around ten rigs I‚Äôve had had been custom-built by me. I‚Äôve been getting better at it. In the end, it brings you personal satisfaction and a better and cheaper experience, since with a bit of tinkering and a few mistakes, in the end you build things that really can last quite longer than your common PC desktop. But is just a quirk, and it‚Äôs only worth it if you‚Äôll extract some pleasure of the process.
You need a configuration that is difficult to obtain 'off the shelf.' Frequently, off the shelf systems put you in a position of buying more than you need in some areas to get what you do need in another. You may have a need of a workstation class GPU but you don't have the need of the Xeon processor, ECC RAM and other components that frequently come in systems that feature the GPU you want (as an example.) If you have specialized needs, building your own can be the best way to get what you need without getting a lot of what you don't.
For myself, I‚Äôve been building PCs since the 1990s, and I buy pre-built systems these days. I bought a Dell XPS desktop a few years ago, and that thing is a beast. I got it during a sale, and I don‚Äôt think I could have built something with similar specs for much cheaper, especially not after shipping.
I paired a i5‚Äì3570 with a GTX 1060 6G just to see how much better the i5‚Äì3570 was over the i5‚Äì2500. The 3570 is amazing by the way‚Äîhitting 3.8GHz about 30% of the time and still hitting an astonishing 39W ceiling compared to about 53W for the i5‚Äì2500 at 3.7GHz. Very impressed I was.
The main thing is that you can choose all of the components that goes into your PC. For example, if you for whatever reason, need to transfer large amounts of data between folders, you might want to opt for an m.2 nvme ssd instead of a slow HDD. If you want to play AAA games at highest settings, you would choose a CPU and Graphics card that is more suitable for your task. This gives YOU supreme control over what you want your PC to be the best at. (and your budget of course).
I am not a pro like Jeremy, but I use computers since 2000, mostly for office work or gaming. So is it worth building a PC? Assembling a PC yourself is always cheaper and it can also be fun if you like technical things with a little bit of tinkering. For some people it becomes a hobby. Upgrading and installing new parts is a bit similar to tinkering with your car or buying new fishing gear. It is worth if you use your PC daily and want to learn a bit more about the internals of your computer. Doing that you also can save a bit money on parts.
Absolutely! I purchased my first computer back in 1992 that was my high school graduation present. It was 486DX-50mhz. Fastest CPU of its time and even outperformed supposedly ‚Äúfaster‚Äù CPU‚Äôs like 66mhz and 75mhz models because they ran on a slower 33mhz and 25mhz bus speeds respectively. The 486DX-50mhz ran at a 50mhz bus speed and ‚Äúrekt‚Äù those slower 25mhz and 33mhz buses when running important apps like Doom and Doom2.
Yes. You can build a PC on your own. In fact, it‚Äôs easy to build your own PC. You‚Äôll need a CPU, a GPU, a good case, a motherboard with the right socket that suits your CPU and your case size, some RAM and SSD for storage. For additional storage, you‚Äôll also want to add a Hard Disk Drive. Plus, you‚Äôll need a Screwdriver(something like a Phillips Head Screwdriver), an anti-static mat or bracelet and some zip ties for cable management. These are some of the required tools you‚Äôll need for building the PC. Some thermal paste may also be needed in case your CPU cooler doesn‚Äôt have enough thermal paste already preapplied. Even though it‚Äôs easy to build a PC, it‚Äôs always important to handle the parts carefully and install them correctly, which may otherwise lead to damage of the PC parts.
When buying a pre-built computer the company building it usually cuts corners on cost wherever they can find it. This leads to many compromises having to be made when buying at a certain price point. Funny enough though, when building your own computer not only do you get a better PC overall but you usually end up paying the same price if not cheaper than a pre-built.
Even for most use cases, building your own PC isn‚Äôt necessarily a better investment than getting a custom build from a PC specialist. The main benefit of building your own is having complete control over what components are used, and what specs you want, and it‚Äôs even easier now with sites like PC Part Picker (they come up in all my answers, but I swear they‚Äôre not paying me!) which can tell you which components will run nice together. It also teaches you more about the workings of your PC which will make it easier to diagnose potential faults in your PC before it stops working completely, and give you the necessary skills to make upgrades or install replacements yourself without paying additional labour. Also it means you don‚Äôt need to pay for Windows if you plan on only using Linux instead (or have an existing transferable license).
When I build systems these days, I ensure there‚Äôs a good solid motherboard, high quality power supply with a lot of additional capacity and a CPU with enough power to do what I want for the life of the system. I almost never buy the OMG! bestest-ist CPU. It‚Äôs not worth the extra cost unless you‚Äôre looking for bragging rights from your geeky friends.
Re-install Windows, fresh install, the best way of getting rid of everything installed, leftovers of programs and possibly virus or malware, just save all your data before that on a different place, since it will have to be formatted (Wiped).
With RAM, what matters is how much is used and whether or not the system is using something known as ‚Äúpaging‚Äù, where it uses part of the hard disk as if it were RAM. If paging is going on, you can get some benefit from increasing the RAM, yet it most likely wouldn‚Äôt be significant except when you are using memory intensive programs. Better clocked RAM can yield some improvement, yet only if the motherboard and CPU can take advantage of it. As at least one other person has stated, memory beyond 8 GB is probably not going to get you far. I would say that as of this writing (June 2018), anything over 16 GB won‚Äôt get you any - even a modest - performance improvement and could actually hurt you (as larger memory sticks tend to be slower than smaller ones by small amounts.).
Replace the thermal compound: the CPU, chipset & any dGPU if exists uses thermal compound to conduct heat more efficiently to the cooling assembly, this thermal compound has an age, so replacing it after few years will give you better thermals insuring lower throttling, eg more consistent performance.
Reinstalling the operating system. This will get you on a fresh copy of your OS of choice, no residual files from uninstalled programs, no completely destroyed registry, no potentially corrupt OS files, etc. You could also take the opportunity to install a light weight operating system like Linux or Ubuntu, both of which are easier on weaker hardware than Windows is. You'd need to make sure the programs you need to use work on Linux natively or through Wine, or use a virtual machine for Windows.
Over the years your laptop accumulates many operating system patches/upgrades, many software upgrades, many unneeded software programs, and many registry keys. On top of that, your hard drive has become very fragmented, meaning it has to go to 20 different locations to get the data for a single file (imagine trying to cook with the fridge in one room, the stove in another, the pantry in another, different locations for each pot/pan, and spices randomly left in different rooms).
Now seriously, it depends on how old it is. The first step is always cleaning it and replacing the thermal paste, that'll make use that is not throttling because of overheating. If after that it wont budge, I'd go with a suitable ammount of RAM to make sure that the OS isn't paging. After that maybe a better processor if you can find one and if it's not too old an SSD. Take note that an SSD won't solve your life if the busses and DMA chip don't have the necessary bandwidth to fully make use of the SSD speeds.
So let‚Äôs look at a task like web browsing because it‚Äôs very likely something people do a lot of on old systems. The most relevant pieces of hardware to the web browsing experience are the Hard drive (SSD or nowadays even optane alternatively is available for usage on modern motherboards), RAM (speed and true latency do matter here, I think 4 gigs is passable without much performance penalty but 8 will definitely be so here), CPU and architechure (likewise with ram the speed of operation and the latency associated with beginning the chain of events to carry out instructions).
Display might develop problems, missing columns/lines due to drivers separating from the glass panel or from the flexible PCB. CCFL backlight is power hungry and has a short life span.
As other answers have noted, the performance bottleneck of older computers is IO, especially to secondary storage like the hard disk. The much lower latency and higher sustained bandwidth of even SATA SSDs would provide very visibly improved performance, and should be compatible with any laptop from the last 10 years having a SATA-III connection to the hard disk.
An SSD will make your operating system boot up faster, as well as launch your applications faster. It generally makes operating your computer a much more fluid experience, but it won't drastically improve the speed of any heavy duty tasks such as editing videos, compiling code, or playing video games.
Manufacturers often use the same mainboard in a range of models, with a lot of options. The high end may have HDMI, a SmartCard slot for security, and various other connectors and options, while the low end of the range will be missing many parts from the board. If one model has a webcam and fingerprint reader, it‚Äôs very likely the connectors for them are on the boards across the whole model range, especially if they‚Äôre available as a build to order option on any of them.
Third, get a better battery. Then a better WiFi card and (if possible) a IPS screen. Then perhaps a good keyboard and/or external/internal mouse.
Memory will improve performance if you are thrashing (swapping so much the computer is spending it‚Äôs time moving things in and out of memory). This can happen if you are running many big applications. If you are just running a browser or some simple program you won‚Äôt get a big increase in performance by increasing memory (unless you have almost none). Personally, I won‚Äôt buy anything with less than 8‚Äì16 GB RAM. That‚Äôs just me.
Note: the thickness of thermal grease is as important as its quality. consider you buy ‚Äúnew shiny‚Äù grease twice better than old, but make it 4 times thickier (200 microns instead 50 microns, very easy). Then you get thermal resitance 2 times worse than before.
The First Answwer is the right one. Replace the Hard disk with an SSD. If you already have an SSD, then make sure it is a quality brand in good working order with up to date firmware and is not full. Any disk that is too full (over 80%) will begin to show performance degradation.
Mining Bitcoin and ultimately Litecoin on my videocard‚Äôs GPUs causes the system to run continuously at its rated temperature maximum for months at a time. In my experience running two cards continuously, I experienced fan failures at ~16 months, both cards failed within a few days. That‚Äôs not bad, considering it was over a year at 95% fan speed. Far longer than I expected. ~6 months later I had a dead card I was able to revive by replacing 3 bulging electrolytic capacitors. The same card failed irreparably some months after that. After that I pulled the remaining card and it‚Äôs now in my ‚ÄúTV‚Äù pc, and is only used for video playback.
If you‚Äôre mining bitcoins on a CPU you‚Äôre going to have a bad time. You want to use a GPU (or lots of GPUs, or I wonder if a TPU is the way to go? [Turns out I‚Äôm way behind - thanks Vladislav Zorov, so ignore this]).
I think it does. I ran 2x 7970 and 2x 7950 GPUs 24/7 for about a year. Mainly it is the cooling fans that fail. I had a capacitor on one card explode in an impressive shower of sparks but that could have been a short (I shorted a pci-e riser on the same card earlier). Since the fans keep the actual GPU running cool, checking the fans, replacing the fans when their bearings fail (when the fan spins slow or unevenly), and occasionally repasting the heatsink should keep your cards running for a long time.
This is the maximum size that the lithography machines can etch, and for 193i immersion steppers (what's currently used) that limit is 33x26 so about 856mm2. My guess is that TSMC has set 815 as the limit for 12nm.
On a GPU, you have these huge thick cards, but heat sinks and fans take up most of that space. The actual circuit board is quite thin. On that board, most of the electronics are power modules for getting electricity to the right voltage and current levels for the processing units. The next biggest things are the memory chips. GPUs these days have gigabytes of on board memory, that‚Äôs more or less the same as a RAM stick directly on the board. Nvidia‚Äôs chips are actually only a few cm^2 on their most powerful cards. They are bigger than Intel because they are essentially thousands of really tiny chips all placed next to each other on the same chip, so one end of the GPU that‚Äôs 1cm away from the the other end doesn‚Äôt really talk to that end anyway, so the speed of light is less important between those two points.
I worked for Univac/Sperry/Unisys for 40 years in the Twin Cities in Minnesota, sometimes known as the first Silicon Valley. Along with Control Data we competed with IBM for the mainframe business. One of our big mistakes was joining the Trilogy Project instigated by a well-known mainframe developer who left IBM. The idea was integrated circuit CPUs on a huge die. We even built a special IC foundry, such facilities are the most expensive by square foot manufacturing operations in the world. The dies were too large for quality return and the whole scheme failed. The building became an airlines IT center and is now a bank HQ. Yes, there is a point of diminishing returns for IC die size.
Another good option is Linux Mint. Linux Mint is built on top of Ubuntu (or Debian) and essentially tries to provide a more elegant version of Ubuntu. It uses a fork of GNOME 3, and comes with some proprietary software installed for easier use.
It has a steep learning curve - you wind up with a system that has no software on it that you didn't compile from source (but the tools for doing that are simple to work with). And it's incredibly non-opinionated - you can use any combination of software you can compile for it - assemble a super lightweight desktop from pieces-parts (I use OpenBox + CairoDock + Stalonetray + a few tray apps and some launch scripts for a Mac-like user experience and blazing performance) - and realize that that's all a "desktop" ever was, and you're not stuck with the choices someone else made. Want power management? What happens when you close or open the lid of your laptop is a script you will write.There never has to be a moment when you don't know what your computer is doing.
Firstly, Linux Mint is a great distro built upon Ubuntu, so if it "hangs", then probably ubuntu and all its derivatives will. Why don't you figure out what your problem is? It could be low amount of RAM and no swap space allocation. Just visit their IRC channel on freenode #linuxmint and ask the people and they will pretty much help you out. You can even find clem (The head of the linux mint project) on IRC.
Why Ubuntu (or Debian)? I really don't want the OS getting in my way when I just want to get by with my day-to-day development work and entertainment. To me, this translates to stable package management with just enough flexibility which when exercised doesn't break everything. Also, a lot of commercial software which I end up needing is conveniently packaged for Ubuntu/Debian.
Arch : Arch linux is the best distro out there if you love tinkering and hacking with your system. It‚Äôs installation process itself teaches you many things about Linux. Install this distro if you want to learn how Linux works or if you want a system thats just like you‚Äôve ever imagined. The main advantage of arch linux is that your packages will always be up to date. I‚Äôll recommend arch linux only if you‚Äôre an at least an intermediate user because it‚Äôs installation process is itself difficult and lengthy for beginners as you have to do most of the things manually via command line. Use this distro if you have enough time, patience and a good internet connection.
The Programmer's Toolkit : First of all essentials toolkit needs to be available for anyone planning to develop. You might want to choose the right IDE.Various conventional IDEs exist with support for C/C++, perl, python and other scripting languages. There are many to choose from and there are a lot of developer tools ranging from Emacs to Eclipse and Sublime Text which does not care about the distro but choosing a the right Desktop environment will relieve you the hassle of having to maintain it everyday.
One thing I appreciate about Debian (and, to a lesser degree, Ubuntu) is that you can every easily set up your system to work with lower level sources which are part of the distribution or available in its extensive repositories.
I can only speak to the kinds of programming I do. Little or no web related stuff, nor host-based stuff. Lots of need for cross toolchains and building those. Hands down, Debian wins (so, maybe Ubuntu, as well...). Everything new, modern and nothing out of date. Wide selection of tools and libraries, and distros that run on embedded hardware platforms like ARM.
That said, if you don't want to waste too much time to setting everything up from scratch, Ubuntu is a good place to start and then based on what requirements you need that aren't catered by Ubuntu, you can decide to switch. Ubuntu being a Debian based distribution and having LTS versions rolled out has a very wide community base and a quick Google search is almost bound to redirect to you to a solution to any issue you might face with it in one such forums.
I am an Electronics & Embedded Systems Engineer, I design electronics circuits and embedded firmware on my laptop which is running Arch Linux since probably more than a year and a half. Before that I used Fedora for about a year. The thing with Fedora was that, although I loved it absolutely and it was very fast, but it was too flaky. Things wouldn‚Äôt work quite often. Also, there was a severe lack of availability of packages in the repositories and this includes the COPR repos that I could find.
If you have a Linux distro that you are used to, such as Ubuntu or Fedora, then just get more used to it and you can make it the best, most amazing development box for you. All the IDEs that I know of are interchangeable between distros. The biggest differences between distros are their packaging utilities, and your program will be developed and then packaged in whatever install binary you need. There is no real reason to choose one over another based on the packaging utility.
However, if you just want a stable and reliable system to facilitate developing software, I'd recommend either an Ubuntu-derivative like Mint, or a Redhat derivative like Fedora or CentOS. You'll find these easy to operate and very flexible in terms of the software packages available.
I‚Äôd suggest the important things are which desktop/UI you want to use, and then decide which Linux distribution that has that desktop/UI has the easiest installation and management. Personally I use Debian Sid and Fedora Rawhide with GNOME. Many people hate GNOME for some reason, I find it great. There are though many UIs for Linux, GNOME, Unity, Cinnamon, Mate, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, to name a few. They all have their adherents and naysayers, the only way to know is to try them all before choosing ‚Äì which is clearly impossible. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, and Arch are arguably the distributions with the largest user base and hence support base. Ubuntu and Fedora have the advantage of being the bases for commercial operations and so they get a lot of commercial input. If push came to shove I would suggest Fedora 25, 26 soon to appear. It starts with GNOME but you can easily switch to LXDE which is probably the best lightweight desktop/UI.
I have never used any Redhat based distros but I know they are used as daily driver and as web server for the longest of time now. They have a good number of packages in their repo and you can also get precompiled RPM packages if you do a little googling. There is a huge community so you will also get support easily.
A. There was a time when I used to download games (usually multiplayer) for me and my friends to play. I would go on a rampage over the Torrents and download every popular game. Soon I had 600 GBs worth of games. And that was just the first year since I got 512 kbps internet at home. I used to download new and popular games as well, even the games in their BETA versions (especially indie games like Broforce, Battle Block Theater, Speed Runners, etc.). ‚ÄúBroforce ‚Äù had become my favorite. I had seen it on kickstarter, but came to know that I would have to buy that game! I searched every torrent site, and downloaded it and played to heart‚Äôs content.
As an indie game developer, I abhor piracy. We work our butts off building our games and then struggle to sell them because we have low marketing budgets. Then some guy plays our game (yay, a sale!), then decides that other people might enjoy it for free and uploads it to a piracy website or server to allow others to avoid paying us for our hard work. It's hard enough as it is to make ends meet without losing sales to piracy. In AAA, it's the same story. They justify higher prices with far larger costs for big teams.
Emulators. Not as ‚Äúillegal‚Äù as pirating new games because these games aren't for sale anymore and aren't being produced so it's not taking away revenue from a company. It's probably the only way to play older games besides buying a used copy off of a 3rd party seller. Classic systems and even last gen systems like NDS and Wii games are easy to set up and play and those games from the 80s and 90s. Also older PC games that aren't being sold anymore.
So much had been invested into the making these games, and it is entirely reasonable to play a specific price to avail the experience. However, various legal gaming sites allow free downloading of PC games for free.
Truth is, there are no reliable sites. All the websites I‚Äôve found will have catches on some, if not most, games. Either they want you to take a survey and then add a crapload of extensions to your browser, or they make you download another annoying program along with the game ‚Äî and then you find the game doesn‚Äôt work and you can‚Äôt uninstall the program with all of it‚Äôs pop-ups because it doesn‚Äôt appear on your computer‚Äôs list of programs.
However, before I get to this argument, I recognise that this question is tap-dancing on hallowed ground, and that I risk awakening Apple disciples. I would therefore like to begin with a clear statement. I DO understand why some people prefer Apple. Apple products work well, are reliable, seamless and don't have the same hassles as Windows based PCs. I can understand that A LOT of people just want their computer to work. They want their computer to accomplish some task - to get them from A to B. I understand why these people prefer the ease of an Apple. Everything is produced by the same company and works well together. If you plug an Apple product into another Apple product then it works. I GET IT.
I will certianly give it to Apple, that you have a guaranteed level of quality for the product you buy, drop $1000 on an HP and you could still end up with a lemon. There is also a clear advantage of reliability when the hardware and software is made by the same company.
Now with that said it also causes a very unfair misconception by general public‚Ä¶. Well I bought the cheapest PC i can find for $250 on Black Friday and who could have guessed it, it was slow and a complete pile of crap, but when I buy the cheapest Mac for $1300 it is good quality. Thus the only rational conclusion here is that PC = crap and Mac = good, the $1000 price difference cant have anything to do with it and it certianly cant be possible that a $1200 dell xps is better performance/quality than the $250 Black Friday special.
As my credential states, I was a video game programmer for several years. In the 1990s, few to no video game were developed on or for Macs. I also played video games, so a PC was the natural choice.
PCs offer freedom to chose your hardware and software as well as design. There are a huge range of PCs that you can choose from and yes some of them are a hell of a lot better than Macs.
As an engineering student I can't get what I want in a Apple Laptop. I bought an HP 2760p Convertible Tablet combined with Microsoft OneNote which is the premier note taking application on the market. Even if I was willing to settle for Evernote there are no Apple pen based convertible laptops.
Mac is designed for people who don‚Äôt know and don‚Äôt want to know how computers work. It works with minimal setup, and it keeps you safe from your own inept self. They make great computers for digital design professions like graphic design and film making, but they are not the first choice of most computer programmers (of course neither is windows). Anyways I‚Äôd like you to come up with a major title released exclusively for Mac. I‚Äôll wait. If you want to play any good games, you have to have a windows pc.
Price. I am not a gamer. My work applications are not hugely resource-intensive. I buy nice little micro-PC desktops with a Core i3, 8GB RAM, 128GB hard drive for about $500. That does everything I need or want. Try doing that with a Mac! I hear arguments that Macs last much longer, and therefore are price competitive for most users, but my personal PC workstation at work is from 2011, and was $400 then.
If you are looking for brute force computing power then the 12 core maxed out Mac Pro super-workstation is your definite choice hands down. Since it makes use of the Mac OS-X operating system which is fully compliant with the ANSI-standard of FreeBSD UNIX and is fully commercially supported. Further more the Mac OS-X makes use of the MACH operating system shell that allows you to dynamically utilize all the processors on the computer at one time (if you program it properly to do so). I have also used LINUX (a toy version of UNIX designed to run on old obsolete MS-WINDOWS based PC‚Äôs). My favorite is still UNIX, since, I‚Äôve both designed built and programmed UNIX based computers and networks for over 40 years. The present incarnations of UNIX are substantially more powerful then the original UNIX running on the AT&T 3B2 series of UNIX computers. Admittedly, PC‚Äôs are cheaper, but, you get what you pay for. WINDOWS based PC‚Äôs can neither support the fully configured high end Mac Pro‚Äôs and MacBook Pro‚Äôs that are the latest in APPLE‚Äôs line of new computers. I personally find the Mac Pro‚Äôs and MacBook Pro‚Äôs to be extremely reliable. I personally used both an 8 core Mac Pro that is maxed out and I have used in heavily for over ten years without any problems whatsoever. I had previously a WINDOWS PC that didn‚Äôt even last two years. My iPAD was cheaper than the WINDOWS PC that I used and the iPAD can run circles around the WINDOWS PC that I had (the iPAD that I use is over ten years old and still works quite reliably). Furthermore, the Mac OS-X operating system has features such as speech recognition and human sounding speech synthesis capability that is built into the operating system from its inception. This means that you will really pay much less for a brand new Mac Pro or MacBook Pro, if you are blind or severely visually impaired like I am. Furthermore, there are a plethora of software tools that come bundled into the Mac OS-X operating system and many more that are downloadable free of charge from the APPLE store. Remember that operating systems like MS-WINDOWS and LINUX were never designed to allow blind computer programmers and computer operators to work them, as a result, it will cost considerably more to make these operating system based machines usable by the blind (the Jaws screen reading program that runs under MS-WINDOWS cost $2,500.00 and that is over $500.00 more than the latest MacBook Pro quad-core computer that is maxed out will cost you. In the LINUX environment, the ORCA screen reading program doesn‚Äôt work with more applications than it really works with, hence, making LINUX based computers really useless for blind people. Most importantly, APPLE has always make all of their computers accessible by the blind and have done so ever since their first personal computer (the APPLE IIC). In conclusion, I can only restate the obvious. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. It‚Äôs that simple.
My main reason, aside from the obvious price to performance ratio disparity is that if something breaks, it can be quickly and reasonably repaired for a fair sum, with my data intact and with little to no headache depending on the component. Also, my PC's motherboard was designed sensibly, which is more than I can say about pretty much any MacBook 2013 and onward.
IMO, people buy Windoze out of ignorance. I nursed my windows computers along for 15 years, having to rebuild them periodically. What a PITA that was, even with backups to fall back on, which SHOULD have gotten me back to last week or last night, but NOOO, I had to twiddle with the registry or worse to be able to work. At home, I just want to use the machine, not fiddle all day.
Simple and short answer : for easy upgradability, quality, and for how much cheaper it can be. Mac's look great and function well but they are an apple product and therefore is expensive compared to a PC of similar or better specs. Plus, if I remember correctly you can't just build and upgrade a Mac nearly as easily as a PC.
Second, if the desire were to actually spend as much as possible, solely on a pre-built system, you‚Äôd still spend more on a Windows system, this time from a boutique maker like Falcon Northwest or iBuyPower. Spend maybe $5000‚Äì6000 on the hardware (probably including two nVidia Titan X (as of Nov.2017) graphics cards, and if a motherboard that supports multiple central processors exists, two Intel i9 Extreme Edition CPUs), and another $500‚Äì3000 on the custom paint job.
I didn't exactly. I mean, I have both. I have a 2009 Macbook running Manjaro, Linux and a 2012 Macbook Air running MacOS. But I also have a Lenovo X201 Laptop running Manjaro, Linux (used to be FreeBSD) and a Desktop PC running Windows 10 (which is primarily built for gaming and Machine Learning AI). I also have a Raspberry Pi with several different OS, and lots of other systems.
PC‚Äôs do however need security programs to be protected, and with a few exceptions, a fresh Windows 10 PC is not as well protected as it needs to be. That said, you can pick up free tools like Macrium Reflect, Rollback Rx, etc to further protect the PC. Even if you pay a premium for better programs, it‚Äôs still far less than a Mac
For "power users", it typically comes down to some piece of software they have to have which only runs on the PC. Gaming is a big reason a lot of people still have a PC. For me, visual studio & trillian are both essential apps that I keep a PC around for
Costs aside (and that is a major aside), there is great flexibility to bend a PC to your will as a "power user" that can never be achieved with a mac. Macs are designed elegantly and with lots of subtle adjustments so that the average user doesn't have to think much. A lot of it has to do what the late Steve Job's philosophy that the company should determine how you should use their products
Once you have learnt their keyboard, you can simply install a keyboard remapping tool on Windows, and remap the keys. With that done, you are just left with the options that the accessibility tool offers. Well, one can certainly live with a few options missing. When you buy a Mac, you essentially pay for a few extra accessibility options, and nothing much else. Majority of PC makers have started to offer PCs that come packaged in aluminium casings, so even that is now not exclusive to Macs. The real question, then, really becomes, why would anyone want to buy a Mac?
Software availability. Apple still doesn't get the kind of software support that Windows does. And often, Mac ports of Windows native software are buggy, which just makes it more difficult
No , not at all . People say that because at one time in history , Windows got so famous as Apple was facing a huge downfall after the exile of Steve Jobs . But now , in the time of today , Apple's Mac OS X is leading the world and amazing the computer tech community with its features and those are really cool . Microsoft is actually a bit down nowadays
Whereas PC had several photo editor, video editor, music, media viewer programs, etc., Mac eliminated all the lesser options and focused on one ultimate, perfected program for each
I actually own both. For my main computer I use is 2011 MacBook Pro, I have a custom build Windows 10 and I have a surface pro laptop. I didn‚Äôt pick one over the other. At the end of the day both operating systems does the same job, they just look different
Once, I was with one of my friends in a local fast food store, eating ‚ÄòShingara‚Äô (a local fast food). After that, he was admiring and telling me ‚Äòbecause of those meats, it was delicious‚Äô. I was flabbergasted. Generally it contains pieces of potato inside it, with spices, vegetables or various grains. My taste was‚Äôt strong, so I didn‚Äôt get that, according to him. I was sure it wasn‚Äôt meat. But he was insisting, it was mixed with potatoes and grains. OK, next day we will see. Then the next we asked them directly, and I was right
My latest Macbook Pro is worse than any PC I‚Äôve ever used. The lack of ports (and super cheap feeling USB-C port, which makes it come unplugged if a butterfly flaps its wings in Hong Kong), horrible keyboard, stupid touchbar, oversized trackpad with weird gestures that constantly hijack typing, and lack of upgradeability have insured this will be my last Apple product
You have to wrestle with Windows to do just about anything. But you can do just about anything. With Mac OS you never have to wrestle. You either do it effortlessly, or you don't do it at all
current robots, no. They need a lot of maintenance they are not able to give themselves, and sincethere is no real IA yet, there is no measure of ‚Äúoutlast‚Äù that makes sense. Sure, their physical frame and even some behaviors or movement patterns can be performed after all humans die, but without a purpose that means they are outlasting as as much as the soil or wind will, which is to say, not really
Learn coding: Start picking up at least one handy programming language. Arduino IDE is good. Python is great. C/C++ will be fantastic. My suggestion would be: Python. There are several reasons for this and later in the road map you will see why
Machine learning, pattern recognition, deep learning, reinforcement learning etc are the hot topics of the century! Take those courses. Get flexible with one of the deep learning frameworks: Tensorflow, Keras, Caffe, PyTorch etc. You will be able to do easily
Robotics is a future oriented industry. Understanding its basics is far more important than directly jumping to its applications. Once the core study is strong, innovations can be brought easily. In India, learning Robotics at your own convenience with recognised universities that have credible faculty and state-of-the-art infrastructure is tough to find. I interacted with one of the Counselors at ImaginXP who gave me an all round information about Robotics with this combination to study and to get a better insight, I have been invited to explore Future Skills at their free webinars. You can be a part of their webinars too by registering on.
Robotics is a fun way to bring STEM to life, and that‚Äôs important because STEM is the key to a successful future for students with the interest and motivation to pursue careers in this field
Programming a robot is one skillset, tweaking its code is another. Algebra makes the technical element of the process easier by enhancing your mathematical skills. Physics helps develop a working understanding of your robot and its interactions with its surroundings. Lastly, computer science is directly related to the field of robotics and so a strong understanding of the former is key to learn the latter
Note, real time applications aren‚Äôt build this way, it‚Äôs just play kit. Every thing needs to be hardwired and use controllers and ICS directly to build applications
I am no expert in Robotics but to understand the basics of the same I usually join Webinars conducted by Industry Experts. Just scratching from the start, people with experience have a lot to share. I recently came across this website ImaginXP which is conducting a big webinar on different future skills
Given the dof -degrees of freedom-(you think your robot will need in order to do an specific task) you have to make a mathematical model of the direct kinematics of the manipulator by using DH (Denavit-Hartenberg) method/algorithm. The direct kinematics will give you the position and orientation of the manipulator given some values of the DH parameters. Then you have to calculate the inverse kinematic (this is the useful one)
You could try my method. I was hired by Apple‚Äôs World Wide Manufacturing Enginnering to handle almost all the factory robotics/automation software in China and Ireland. I didn‚Äôt know a thing about it. But after four years and about a half dozen long term trips overseas I learned it on the job. Of course, I had 35 years experience, half of which was at Apple. I guess my track record spoke for itself
Then go for learning IoT : This comes as next step as now you are able to collect data on a hardware device and operate machines over bluetooth/radio waves but you don't have knowledge how two hardware devices can communicate with each other over internet, so learn IoT by using simple Arduino supported micro-controller like Nodemcu
Programming skill is important. But not as critical as you would be lead to believe. Software application programming experience is not really helpful for robotics, beyond giving you a good working knowledge of the language. A robot works on a different level than your average computer app (unless you are doing plan based robots, like CNC machines, pick and place robot arms, etc). Robots have to adapt to changing obstacles and environments, and their code has to take all this into consideration. Its not as easy as ‚Äúif X then Y‚Äù. Point im getting at is you will have to learn to program differently if you want to create an interesting autonomous robot, so already being a programmer is not a major help
Although simple networks are prone to weight explosion, this sounds odd. For, as far as I know, MNIST data is already normalized, and any built-in image readers of standard NN toolkits do normalize data automatically as well. Maybe something is wrong with the normalization method you use? Could it be that you employ pixel-wise Z-score and then push it through a ReLU?
There is a lack o details in your question. We have to concern activation functions that your network employs. If it is sigmoid, then it is necessary to express the problem by numbers close to zero, because just there the gradient is significant and training would be too slow otherwise. Another aspect is depth of your network. Having more than three layers you have to use some mechanism for prevention of the vanishing gradient problem, normalization is one such solution
The most popular language in robotics is probably C/C++ (C++ is an object-oriented successor to the C language). Python is also very popular due to its use in machine learning and also because it can be used to develop
Robotics is a fairly new ground to play for Indian professionals. There are certain computer languages that one needs to learn when it comes to implementing robotics processes. In these languages, the core ones are C and C++. They help in formulating and executing basic to complex levels of programs. Apart from that, new age professionals also indulge in Python and R languages. Having an indepth knowledge about all of the languages will give you an upper hand, that‚Äôs for sure
Python is preferred for prototyping using libraries like Probst, Pyro, DART etc. Once you prototype your project. People back port their code in c/c++ for production level performance
C++ and Python are definitely the programming language that you use at the end. However, the codes for most of the robots these days live inside an operating system called ROS (Robot Operating System). ROS provides an elegant software architecture for easier robot control and planning. There are these different node programs that you write that can publish certain information that can be used by other nodes living inside ROS. For example, the localization node that estimates the position of a drone in the 3d world would publish this information for other nodes to use. A trajectory planner node can then subscribe to these nodes to get this data to evaluate the next path for the drone. Each of these nodes are simple C++ or Python codes
The programming languages used in robotics are actually the same programming languages used for everything else. This isn‚Äôt the case for all code, as some manufacturers develop their own languages to use alongside the more common ones
Java has recently drawn traction from companies to develop support framewokrs. Other small players like MATLAB and Octave are just trying to stay in the race by developing support for robotics and related platform (e.g Peter Corke‚Äôs robotics library in MATLAB) that they hope their loyal academic audience follows
Python and C/C++ are the most popular languages for robotics programming. C and C++ are popular because these languages are used in a lot of hardware libraries that are used in robotics. Compared to Python, C/C++ aren‚Äôt as simple. If you‚Äôd write the same function in C and Python, it‚Äôd be much more complicated and take longer in the first language compared to the latter.
Jupyter notebook (JUlie, PYThon, R) is web-based open-source software for creating and sharing documents, containing live code.
First you have to understand the purpose of notebooks or notebook documents. These are documents in which you bring together code and rich text elements (figures, links, equations, ‚Ä¶). In the case of Jupyter Notebook, these notebook documents can be produced by the Jupyter Notebook App.
Basically it is a combination of an IDE, server to run your projects (called notebooks) either on your local computer or remotely, and has support for approximately 40 computer languages. It originally was for the languages, Julia, Python, and R. The notebooks contain both code and presentation elements, such as images or calculations together in one place. The notebooks are run/ interpreted via kernels, which seem like virtual machines and will use memory of the computer running it. The memory will not be released until exiting the execution of the notebook. You can also use it with Docker containers. This is just a brief and basic summary to the best of my understanding. Hope this helps.
The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
Jupyter is actually and interaactive computing environment that enables users to edit and run code from the browser,create and use interactive javascript widgets,author narrative text using markup languauge . Basically ,it allows you to program in a web browser-its a mix of code, instructions and output and all of this information is displayed inline in one web page which makes it very useful for writing a code that tells a story,also it provides a self contained record of computation that can be converted into various formats and shared using email ,dropbox ,version control system like github.
Seems to be getting more popular. I have noticed some of my postdoc colleagues giving oral and demo presentations from their Jupyter notebook. We also constructed some machine learning tutorials for industry and board members using Jupyter. It can do some awesome stuff. I imagine future educational workshops using Jupyter notebook rather than MATLAB or mathematica.
For that purpose Jupyter notebook has come in handy for my group. For few of our projects we present our work on Jupyter. Making tweaks to parameters and running the code beneath that change has drastically reduced the feedback time for clients - down to a couple of seconds.
Some IT programs are basically web development degrees ‚Äì which mainly offer courses pertaining to web page and web application development ‚Äì while others tend to be mote pertinent to MIS or a business degree. It is always a good idea to check the program's coursework first.
Information technology provide technical courses that will help you in building your career. If you opt for information technology there are various technical courses and I can say that you can never feel regret for choosing this field.
Choose IT ONLY if you are passionate about computers and it‚Äôs related technologies. Programming is a must skill for any computer science student and if you hate it or don‚Äôt like it, then don‚Äôt go for IT. People say IT is easy. Its not, unless you have passion or like towards it. If you are, then IT is an amazing ocean to swim! Opportunities in IT field never dies. It always grows. That‚Äôs one good thing about it.
If we look at the past few decades, we will realize that there has been a revolution in computing and communications. This indicates that technological progress and the use of information technology will continue at a faster pace. It won't be wrong to say that information technology has infiltrated even the smallest business. In this age of rising technology use, this is one field that continues to expand, providing a multitude of opportunities for IT-savvy individuals who wish to start up their own business.
Information Technology: Specific technologies related to collecting, manipulation and conveying information. This stream came into existenceduring internet era and became super famous (and also due to greediness of Engg colleges you know extra stream, so extra seats, extra money), kind of a younger sibling to CSE. Any technology highly dependent on information like Computer Networking, Web technologies, mobile technologies (apps), Computer Graphics, digital marketing and advertising, e-commerce and many more come under this stream. All the mentioned topics that got revolutionized by advent of internet. So, it would be wise to call this stream as Internet Technologies rather than Information Technologies.
Information systems (IS) is concerned with the information that computer systems can provide to aid a company, non-profit or governmental organization in defining and achieving its goals. It is also concerned with the processes that an enterprise can implement and improve using information technology. IS professionals must understand both technical and organizational factors, and must be able to help an organization determine how information and technologyenabled business processes can provide a foundation for superior organizational performance. They serve as a bridge between the technical and management communities within an organization.
If you have an interest in computer hardware and software, And you are not sure which career way to choose. You want to master information technology (IT) and computer science. These two profitable careers each require a different set of skills. An IT career associate is installing, organizing, and maintaining computer systems as well as designing and operating networks and databases. Computer science is focused on programming computers using mathematical algorithms. An IT career doesn‚Äôt necessarily require a computer science degree, although a CS degree opens particular doors that otherwise would not be feasible. IT professionals usually work in a business environment installing internal networks and computer systems and perhaps programming. Computer scientists work in a deep range of situations, starts from businesses to universities to video game design companies. Both of these careers have excellent growth and high salaries, with software developers somewhat ahead of IT professionals in earnings.
"Computer Engineering" (CE) it is the hardware equivalent to "software engineering". It focuses on computer architecture, particularly at the "ISA" ¬ùlevel: ISA, SIMD, micro-architecture, caches, multi-threading; digital system design (logic design); numerical analysis and control (DNC), manufacturing (CAM); communications: standards, theory, design and signal processing.
IT is the business side of computers usually dealing with databases, business and accounting.One way to think of it is that IT deals with the application of computing technology to real life processes and CSE deals with the ‚ÄúScience‚Äù that facilitates these application.
IT and computer sciences at the core level, deal with the same domain- computing. But they vary substantially in the type of knowledge they deal with. While Computer Science(CS) focuses primarily on computing technologies, and is technology in heavy dealing with principles of programmes, languages, machine level technologies and so on. After competing the course one can primarily find jobs in research and development, language development, machine level coding, and core programming.
It really depends on A.) The program at your university. B.) What you want out of a career. In my experience, the IT program at my university focuses on the practical application of software rather than the common theoretical approach found in computer science. I have been able to specialize in application development and database programming courses, while my friends in CS are stuck with the drudgery of theory. In my opinion, if you want to be a software developer find a degree that focuses on the practical application of writing software and learn core CS fundamentals such as Data Structures on your own time to fill in the gaps.
Information technology is an umbrella term that‚Äôs about the technologies used in delivering solutions to business needs with computer systems, networks, storage and software. Consequently degrees in information technology will be focused on those areas. There might be programming courses but they will be focused on students becoming familiar with a couple of languages and common programming concepts.
Again, as per the curriculum, IT deals with 50‚Äì55% of Networking which will include studies of hardware like Switches, Hubs, most likely Cisco hardware as well as software knowledge which basically includes the network terms like data packet, TCP/IP, UDP, the Open System Interconnection model etc. And rest of the syllabus includes programming that would be used by the students to make their final year projects like writing a Web Crawler/Spider etc.
CSE and IT are quite similar.However, students in CSE are involved in designing microprocessors,personal computers and writing code for software that powers them, whereas a student involved in IT sector deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to store , protect process, transmit and retrieve data and also their further studies is very much related to networking.
Both courses have the same outline, but the main difference is that CSE students learn about the hardware essentials of a computer system. Whereas IT students mainly focus on the software components of a system. This is why you‚Äôll see subjects that relate to electronics for the CSE students - such as Embedded Systems and Microprocessing.
The major difference between both these field is that IT deals with the application of computing technology to real life processes, while, Computer Science deals with the science that facilitates these applications. To make it short and simple, Computer Science is the creation of software and hardware by using different programming skills. On the other hand, IT is just the selection of the proper software or hardware for the task.
I'm from information technology and I'm sure the only difference is the name I guess becoz few friends of mine are studying in cs they study the same stuff and we do almost everything the same. .earlier it was not like this. . The information technology ppl used to learn only the software part while the cs ppl both...so that they had the chance of attending both the software as well as hardware companies. . But now we IT ppl learn hardware subjects too....And other thing is some subject in cs have the lab which are not in IT and vice versa:)
Yes, both are different branches and have different aspects in the industry but as per Job prospect and after college career journey it won‚Äôt mattar. The company hires both CS &IT students gets the same job / piece of work or projects (90%). But in a broader way , absolutely CS & IT are different and have different broader aspects
Okay.. The main difference between information technology and Computer Science is the latter involves more detailed study of hardware : specifically the architectures of micro processors and micro controller. The architectures are logical and required for assembly programming. While in the former I.E. Information technology, subjects related to information processing and management are introduced. Programming part is more or less same in both. The matter of fact regarding placements is that we work at a shallow level and we view people working at a shallow level where the knowledge of any of them will suffice. Nevertheless entry in information technology field is not that difficult, even mechanical and production engineers work in it
Information Technology has mostly software subjects whereas Computer Science has both software and hardware.I feel that Computer Science branch is more in demand than Information Technology(I.T.).If you want to opt for I.T. than you have another option of BSc.(I.T.).Both Engineering(I.T.) course and BSc(I.T.) course have subjects and the advantage of taking BSc(I.T.) over Engineering(I.T.) is that you can save your money. As BSc(I.T) has less tuition fee than Engineering.Why pay more if you are getting the same knowledge in BSc. Make a wise decision, as it is going to decide your future.
On the other hand Information Technology is originated from Computer Science. So it is more about interacting with computer languages. And designing and developing the softwares. It more about creating new softwares using the computer languages and technologies.
I don't know exactly but i feel like it depends on the college you join.I am a student of CSE at NITK Surathkal.In our college we both almost all have similar subjects with different names.But if we see regarding placements,Internships we both have equal priorities and opportunities in everything in our college.They can attend everything that we attend.The very one thing that differs is when you go in to the real world IT people have some lesser priority when compared to CSE.Overall i can say is there isn't much difference.
There is overlap. IT often focuses on business, hardware, cabling, and networks and server administration. Computer Science tends to focus on programming systems, and the question of what is decidable, software engineering would focus on the design of large systems by large teams.
A software engineering certificate gives understudies precise instruction in particular arithmetic and software engineering. Most CS graduates need to become programming designers or Web software engineers. With a multi year CS qualification, understudies can discover work as developers, programming designers, or IT experts, But to be a product engineer, graduates must show themselves a considerable amount of programming all alone. A CS instruction plans understudies to pick the right structure examples, calculations, and information structures for programs. Most understudies graduate knowing just a couple of programming dialects, generally C++, Python, or Java. For most corporate programming occupations, C++ alone may do the trick, yet an expert programming designer should know a few different dialects, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, Python, and Java. Programming engineer employments are anticipated to grow 22 percent throughout the following ten years, well better than expected.
Software engineering is a deliberate and even minded approach to manage calculation and applications identified with this. It is the logical investigation of the articulation, structure, and motorization of the estimations that cause the making sure about, portrayal, planning, accumulating, and admittance to information.
In a very general sense Information technology is exactly as its name, sharing of information using technology. Information technology is basically the use of computers or other technological devices to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information. An IT system is an information system, a communications system or a computer system that includes hardware, software, and peripheral equipment, operated by a group of IT users.
NLTK is a string processing library. It takes strings as input and returns strings or lists of strings as output.Whereas, spaCy uses object-oriented approach.When we parse a text, spaCy returns document object whose words and sentences are objects themselves.
NLU is a subset of NLP in which an unstructured data or sentence is being converted into its structured form for performing NLP in terms of handling end to end interactions. Relation extraction, semantic parsing, sentiment analysis, Noun phrase extraction are few examples of NLU which itself is a subset of NLP. Now to work in these areas TextBlob plays a great role which is not that efficiently done by NLTK.
I have used both.I found NLTK to offer much more functionality than TextBlob. i would suggest you to look into Stanford CoreNLP too. It offers some functionalities which NLTK doesn't offer.
For beginner textBlob is easy and can understand well. try NLTK in next level. Anyhow Textblob is build upon NLTK and it simplifies the way of dealing.
The term ‚ÄúNumPy‚Äù is an abbreviation for NUMerical Python. Apart from helping the developers in scientific computing, this library is also employed extensively for Deep Learning and Machine Learning. NumPy has become quite popular among data scientists because it supports N-dimensional arrays. Being quite complicated, Machine Learning algorithms require multidimensional array operations. Besides this, TensorFlow and several other libraries take the help of NumPy for computing tensors internally. In a nutshell, large multidimensional array objects are supported by NumPy for working with them.
Since Python has gained a lot of momentum in the field of data science in recent years, I would like to list some of the most useful libraries for data scientists and engineers based on recent experience. Moreover, since all libraries are open source, we have increased the number of submissions, contributors, and other metrics from Github, which can serve as a proxy indicator for library popularity.
Numpy - Arguably the most used library by data scientists. The heart of this library is the ndarray data structure (Python‚Äôs standard library doesn‚Äôt have an array data structure) which allows programmers to actually do math and scientific stuff. It also has some (but not much) support for linear algebra.
IPython/Matplotlib/Numpy/Scipy - I admit, there is a learning curve, but you can pretty much replace most of MATLAB with this combination (but a lot of people still use MATLAB). I understand MATLAB is great for a lot of analysis, but if your algorithm is going to be integrated into a web service, why not just start in Python?
Requests will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python. With it, you can add content like headers, form data, multi part files, and parameters via simple Python libraries. It also allows you to access the response data of Python in the same way.
I've listed some important modules of Python. However, have an abstract knowledge about Python's standard library is good. This will help to choose the perfect modules to solve problems and tasks.
Stackoverflow: Stackoverflow have tons of question and answers regarding python. It comes to rescue when examples and docstring from help() method is not sufficient or available. Ask for help about specific usecase like function parameters etc.
I can't stand Stackoverflow. As someone who has a BS in Software Engineering, I can't tell you the number of times I've banged my head against the wall, and I ask a question from time to time. Like how do I get proper exchange of data from a java server to a c# clients readbytes. It's a harder question than it sounds, but you get some 15 year old kid closing your thread.
I am praying for google to create an alternative to Stackoverflow. I am tired of their moderators. Neither do they allow questions to be asked, nor do they allow them to be answered. It looks like most of the new questions appear to them as ‚Äòlow quality‚Äô. I can‚Äôt digest their quality requirements. It is unfortunate that they currently have the largest amount of information, (just like Facebook has the largest functional social network). Stackoverflow started off with ‚ÄòAmercian‚Äô ideals and ended up becoming Soviet Union. Too much moderation/downvoting sucks. Instead of appreciation, I got negative votes after researching more than an hour to answer a question. I decided to never write again in Stackoverflow sites.
The moderators of Stack Overflow and even the ‚Äúhighly intelligent‚Äù developers who answer are soo rude. For people new to technology and less experience, they can only expect rude comments as to how badly formed the question is and are just shown how stupid they are which is absolutely uncalled for.
I've found Stack Overflow very helpful at times but it also pisses me off when you ask a very specific question AFTER trying about a billion searches and then get negged for it. OR, you don't get any responses. There are some very helpful people there but an alternative that encourages discussion rather than trying to limit it in this context would be nice.
I recommend to avoid both Stackoverflow and Programmers SE, stick to books and google searches and educate yourself without external help. The biggest problem with the internet is that there's ton of beginner tutorials, but very little information above beginner level.
However, for programmers , stack overflow is just awesome, with programming question. Nice code formatting opportunity, option for editing are just amazing. Also the quality answers are available.
No comments around the assert describe what the module state is, how it interacts with the ‚Äúapp module state,‚Äù or why they must not be equivalent at that point, or why anyone on earth, living or dead, should have to care about the difference between the module state and the app module state.
Here is a personal story that I will always remember. When I started my PhD, I was assigned as a TA for the Databases class at my university. I had some basic knowledge of DB‚Äôs and SQL, but that was, honestly, way over my head at that point. The professor was a senior DB consultant from Oracle, so I was looking forward to learning a lot from him.
If you mean using Stack Overflow as a reference to find how to do something in a particular language, then yes, all the time; especially if you learn multiple languages, you'll often forget how to do a particular thing in a language. If you mean to look up the documentation for an API or framework that you're currently using, then yes. You might be the greatest coder in the world, but if you're using an API you've never used before, you have to look it up.
API stands for Application Programming Interface. In this example, the application is the box itself. The interface is the understanding between you and the box. In other words, it is an interface for programming the application (the box). The API, therefore, lets you know how to write out the commands to make the box do stuff.
Clearly, both are means of communications. The difference is that Web Service almost always involves communication over network and HTTP is the most commonly used protocol. Web service also uses SOAP, REST, and XML-RPC as a means of communication. While an API can use any means of communication e.g. DLL files in C/C++, Jar files/ RMI in java, Interrupts in Linux kernel API etc.
A mobile app is running with anyone of the platform are android, ios, xamarin etc. As well as the websites are running with php, .net, etc.. so here the mobile app and websites are transferring the data through web services. i can login my account through mobile app, as same i can login by website too. The work flow is - Getting the inputs are username and password in android codes, then it sends to the website by using HTTP verbs. the website capture this request from HTTP verbs and calls the right function and returns the output for the request in the format of either JSON or XML. Most probably if we using REST method we got the result as JSON format, if we using SOAP method we got the result as XML format. The Android codes gets the output values from JSON or XML format results.
Web Service. A web service is a collection of APIs working together to perform a particular task. Web service can be accessed using a transport protocol. HTTP is a far more popular transport protocol to send a request and get a response to and forth from a web service. Using a web service does requires us to be online in the first place.
For example, most APIs have active, well-maintained portals with documentation, samples, help and forums that support developers to use the API. Many Web Services have lacked in this area. APIs typically have analytics, monitoring and may also be monetized: Web Services have often lacked good management and have not made those things visible to users.
There are then middle man servers called Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs) that duplicate the API definition thereby enabling the virtualization of the services and the servers themselves. This allows for massive scaling of the services being accessed through the APIs. Imaging having a standard CRUD service that needs to be accessed millions of times per day. The ESB makes its copy of the API public so everything on the outside points to the ESB, then depending on need, creates as many instances of the service as needed and as many servers as needed. This is referred to as the Micro Server Architecture and is truly the real power of APIs.
Web Service: A web service is a collection of APIs working together to perform a particular task. Web service can be accessed using a transport protocol. HTTP is a far more popular transport protocol to send a request and get a response to and forth from a web service. Using a web service does requires us to be online in the first place.
An API (Application Programmer Interface) is any set of rules a programmer must follow to use a particular service in his computer program that he is developing. For example, Microsoft‚Äôs Win32 provided operating systems services to programmers‚Äô programs and it had a set of rules to follow to use those services. Mainly, they were specific subroutine calls and data structures.
There you have it: an API is an interface that allows you to build on the data and functionality of another application, while a web service is a network-based resource that fulfills a specific task. Yes, there's overlap between the two: all web services are APIs, but not all APIs are web services.
API refers to Application Programming Interface. In general, an API is a set of functions and procedures which allows you to access the data and functionality of an already existing application. It can use any protocol like HTTP/HTTPS. It supports XML as well as JSON.
SOAP & REST are webservices. Okay, what's a webservice?
In a nutshell, Webservice is a software that's platform independent. If you design it to give 'bar' by taking 'foo' it does it irrespective of who gives 'foo'.
If you create a webservice in Java Language and host it on a server, an application written in PHP/.NET/C# etc.. can use that application. As simple as that.
A mobile app is running with anyone of the platform are android, ios, xamarin etc. As well as the websites are running with php, .net, etc.. so here the mobile app and websites are transferring the data through web services. i can login my account through mobile app, as same i can login by website too. The work flow is - Getting the inputs are username and password in android codes, then it sends to the website by using HTTP verbs. the website capture this request from HTTP verbs and calls the right function and returns the output for the request in the format of either JSON or XML. Most probably if we using REST method we got the result as JSON format, if we using SOAP method we got the result as XML format. The Android codes gets the output values from JSON or XML format results.
JSON and XML are both encoding schemes. An encoding scheme is a way of representing or "packaging" information for transmission. They are very similar to other codes you may be familiar with such as Morse Code or Pig Latin or even the English Language. Basically they provide a standard way for the transmitter of a message to be understood by any receiver of the message anywhere in the world.
XML is a markup language (like HTML) that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable and also used for transfering data between a server and a browser.
Looks like Google has big troubles to deploy a new technology, while everyone else is updated. From my estimation major providers won over 30% accuracy and Google stays in 2019. Even open source libraries grow out Google accuracy. So Google is not recommended anymore. Microsoft and Amazon show very good results.
The well-accepted and popular method of interacting with electronic devices such as televisions, computers, phones, and tablets is speech. It is a dynamic process, and human speech is exceptionally complex. The speech recognition engines offer better accuracy in understanding the speech due to technological advancement. A study indicates that from 2019 to 2025, the global speech and voice recognition market can reach $26.79 billion.
To deal with other toolkits like HTK, CMU-Cam SLM, this open source speech recognition software adopts standard formats. Various types of speech recognition system can be built by putting up their own models and modules that are apt for the task. Both acoustic models and language models are pluggable. The various applications offer the speech recognition capability as the core engine is put into practice as an embeddable library. The user can extend the engine as the recent version supports plug-in capability.
You can use the API for only ASR (speech recognition), but it works even better if you want to do intent/entity extraction to build voice user interfaces or voice powered services on any platform (iOS, Web, Android, Unreal Engine etc.)
I would also include Nuance NDEV, it provides both Speech Recognition using Nuance Recognizer and Text-to-Speech. It supports vocabularies, dictionaries, dictation, etc and is probably one of the best cloud based solutions.
The top brands like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, etc., all have solutions, offering some sorte of integration for developers. At present state, all work quite impressively, but all have issues and limitations for the more demanding applications. If you are searching for a development solution you should try out a few of them and/or check other people evaluations.
Microsoft Azure Bing Speech API is a part of the Microsoft Azure cloud services. The speech-to-text task in Azure Bing Speech API offers features like real-time processing, customization, text formatting, profanity filtering, text normalization.
I imagine Quora doesn't want to release any actual useful data on its API for fear that people will just replicate parts of Quora on other sites and make it unnecessary for people to actually come to Quora. Which as they don't sell ad space as far (as I can tell) I would guess it is probably because they are selling that data (i.e. our questions and answers, and various info about views and upvotes etc.) to somebody else. Perhaps they are under contract not to offer the data to another party or something.
XML has its ancestors in sgml, a document markup language. The worst of the idea to use it for object serialization is not the inherent verbosity, but its freedom. One has million ways to define mappings between the objects of an application and xml representation. And each mapping is a language with rules itself.
JSON and XML are human readable formats and are language independent. They both have support for creation, reading and decoding in real world situations. We can compare JSON with XML, based on the following factors
I had a client connecting to a http server that connected to win servers with wmi. The server would use wql to get a dataset back. C# easily serialized it to xml, I didn't have to do anything to it to send it over http. On a C# client I could use a built in parser or load it back into a dataset/datagrid. On a web client I could use xslt or css and I was done. All depends on the use case.
Use what is most suitable. JSON simplifies sending code to browsers, is easier to read (by eye), and has a very low impedance mismatch when talking to JavaScript (or similar languages with an appropriate library). XML is more complex, with better tooling, namespace handling, etc, but some of the related technologies are poorly implemented/over-engineered (SOAP), have a high cost of entry (XSL), or duplicate each other (schemas).
People claim JSON is better because it uses fewer characters (i.e. no end tags), but XML is much richer. The only other advantage that JSON had was because you had to escape ',",<,>,& characters in XML, which is extremely inconvenient if you want to store code / logic, like in MathMod for example. But this problem has been solved with XPL (eXtensible Process Language) that can either be used instead of XML or very rapidly transformed into valid XML (even instantly using Java concurrency).
For example, if you storing 20 customers order information into XML and JSON. And sending this information from the server to client in web and mobile application. Then JSON around 30% less size which optimize the speed of application.
XML is better suited to a server-side presentation layer that can perform XSL transformations. If you're looking for client-side interaction with the raw data then JSON is the way to go, it has a smaller footprint in terms of size and is readily parsed into Javascript objects.
JSON‚Äôs primary advantage is in the data transfer and exchange domain. It is simply lightweight: it has a smaller size and does not require complicated libraries or software to parse and process it. This allows the availability of simple and quick libraries to parse and process it in many languages and environments. The JSON website lists almost 200 tools and libraries for over 60 different languages. Escaping for values is simple, unlike the HTML like syntax in XML. For JavaScript, JSON can be easily parsed into a ready to use object and back with a standard JavaScript function.
JSON is best for use of data in web applications from web services because of JavaScript which supports JSON. The overhead of parsing XML nodes is more compare to a quick lookup in JSON.
First, I won't cite XSLT as a good thing because it is a thing of the devil. Yes, it's handy, but I like to avoid it when/if possible. Debugging is a bitch depending on the tools you have available.
XML easily represents trees; using tag IDs, XML can easily represent graphs. XML schemas can be used to define strong constraints on valid data, making it easier to build mechanical checks for data sanity. JSON has nothing like a schema definition. Formally parsing XML technically is stupidly complicated because of all of the escapes and extensions, and you‚Äôll need such a parser if you are going to use the schema for mechanical checking. Good news: it is easy find such parsers; bad news: they are correspondingly stupidly big meaning you can‚Äôt write a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù program (e.g., something you might want to put in an IOT node). If you don‚Äôt care about code space, this won‚Äôt matter. But if you don‚Äôt need all the bells and whistles of XML, you can stick with just using an ad hoc set of nested tags. This is exactly as hard to parse as JSON.
I think it comes down to what you need: If you just want a simple interchange for adhoc data structures between systems you mostly control, JSON is great. If you want to establish a cross-platform and cross-organizational standard at internet scale, XML is probably better right now.
While there is overlap; XML is geared toward document transport, Json is geared toward data transfer. Json benefit more structure data, while XML favours rather freeform data. Json typically requires programming to be handled while XML can more easily be treated as a document. Context is everything, the choice is entirely a horses for courses situation but their capabilities are so similar the final decision usually boils down to avoiding technology proliferation than outright advantages.
But so is XML, and I believe XML predates JSON. So why does JSON exist? The answer is that XML was designed by committee. Or perhaps more accurately, XML was mutated by committee. XML started as a fairly simple format, but then various experts added features, such as name spaces, references, DTDs, etc. Every added feature had a use ‚Äî but the result was a difficult-to-parse mess.
JSON is simply what you‚Äôd get if you printed out a Javascript object. This is called ‚Äúserialization‚Äù or ‚Äúmarshalling‚Äù in distributed programming. Let‚Äôs say I have an object I want to send from a server to a client. I can use lots of ways to send object data between two computers. CORBA, RMI, or SOAP used to be the main way to send data between two computers. They worked well to interoperate between C and Java and other application languages, but you had to be pretty fluent in order to use those well and the data formats were usually highly compact (often binary) so they didn‚Äôt read well.
JSON was originally a standard way of quickly defining simple objects in JavaScript. You just placed a comma-separated list of key-value pairs between some curly brackets and they became the properties of the object. The neat trick was that the values in the key-value pairs were objects themselves, so you could nest JSON within JSON. i.e. it was extensible.
In recent years, JSON has largely replaced XML, because of its lighter weight and easier interpreting by machines. In fact, JSON has become so ubiquitous that many software products can both import JSON as well as export into JSON.
JSON, or Java Script Object Notation, is a data interchange format. similar to XML or CSV, that is used extensively in Java Script code. It is also the input and output data format for several document oriented NoSQL databases and some RDBMS systems that support it. Examples of database systems that support and use JSON include: MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, CouchBase, CouchDB, DocumentDB, MarkLogic.
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. Squarespace uses JSON to store and organize site content created with the CMS.
In a nutshell, the purpose of JSON is to provide a lightweight and language independent data exchange format that is easy to understand by both humans and machines. Historically, it grew out of a need to perform stateful, real-time browser/server communications without using browser plug-ins.
When a computer is processing through something, what it‚Äôs doing is loading data that the CPU needs to read into memory. When it does this, it‚Äôs really just storing numbers to read, and these numbers only have meaning on the basis of how the software is interpreting them.
The name itself suggests its purpose. In case of Object Oriented Programming, we define the structure of an object which is nothing but the internal memory representation of data. Let's take the following scenario in Java (Which should be similar for any OOP language).
The APIs provide functionality like analytics, machine learning as a service (the Prediction API) or access to user data (when permission to read the data is given). Another important example is an embedded Google map on a website, which can be achieved using the Static maps API,
If you want interactivity, like adding a marker, you will need at least some Javascript. It is perfectly reasonable to use a Python framework like Django for your main application, and use Javascript for event handling and for the direct interaction with Google‚Äôs maps API. Typically you would use Python for the database lookup and fill in an HTML template, and in that template you would create Javascript calls for each marker or for an array of markers.
Create some low-fi early prototypes (paper, wireframes, etc) and test these with your early adopters. Iterate the solution based on customer feedback rather than too many assumptions. Look for strong signals and double down on these. Always look for opportunities and be open to new ideas as the project evolves. DON'T write a 50 page technical specification or detailed schema until you've validated your business model (and even then I wouldn't recommend it). Develop prototypes rather than documenting how things would work.
For productions systems, if someone ask how long I would take to create, lets say, a new backend feature and my answer was 1 week, if than I was asked to create a holy new ‚Äúpage‚Äù (module/screen/window/page) to control it, I would say that the same job would jump to 3 weeks. That is because I know that, usually, the frontend is more demanding than the backend. Not because it‚Äôs necessarily harder, just because it is more demanding of attention to details. In the backend sometimes I can get the job done with just 1 new function called in the right place. But the front end, it will always be a bunch of functions to control all the aspects of the UI and ‚Äútalk‚Äù to the backend to call just that single new resource.
A frontend developer‚Äôs job may be easier than a backend developer‚Äôs, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy. You still have to ensure that your site or app functions well from an end-user perspective, and you have to manage the codebase of your project from start to finish. But you also have fewer moving parts to worry about because you aren‚Äôt building the system from scratch ‚Äì you‚Äôre adding features and making fixes on top of something that already exists.
I do both front and back. I find the back to be boring and mundane. It‚Äôs always the same crap over and over. Write your sql to get your data (usually easy), create a web API that can be consumed (you‚Äôre literally creating just an access point to your data. nothing exciting about that). If you have a batch app that runs on a schedule or something it gets slightly more interesting but still most are pretty simple.
Thats why they‚Äôre backend developers. I am a full stack developer and I can tell you that frontend development is not easier. I would rather be a backend dev any day than a front end simply because your designs/implementations/look and feel have to be able to run across browsers, various use case interactions etc while on the backend you typically work on one environment with connected DBs and services etc. So in my very humble opinion, frontend is not easier.
20 years ago interfaces were considerably simpler. When Javascript was in its infancy, there wasn‚Äôt much it could do, however, it was often used to tweak things, in short bursts of hacky, brittle code. Even the name Javascript wasn‚Äôt inspiring a lot of confidence. And sure, there were more to interfaces than the web but those interfaces were also much more basic than what they are today. And while front-end tasks then presented their unique set of challenges, most of the heavy lifting of an application was handled on the backend - it was the backend that required performant algorithms, that could handle large-scale data, that required clever architecture, etc.
And then it has JavaScript. This is mostly to activate on events on the web page; for example, you might talk to the back end server over HTTP to ship JSON objects back and forth; so you might display a text entry field with a credit card number field, and then know by the leading digits that you look up in the back end database that it‚Äôs a Visa card. Or you might output a location based on a zip code.
For web it's because it used to be easier. Basic HTML, CSS and some basic JS is all that was needed. Most of the concerns were just cross browser compatibility. The challenging work would be for complex UIs with performance requirements‚Ä¶ but that's probably about it.
I have only dealt with CSS a few times and mostly on hobby projects, but I must tell you, it is ugly as hell, has counterproductive syntax and sometimes it poses like something it isn't. I have heard of cases when a frontend guy had to write half a page of this nightmare just to position a button at the center of a box which resides on the left side of the screen.
A lot of guys here defending frontend, which is fair. They seem to think that backend is just coding that doesn‚Äôt involve an interface. Well I‚Äôm going to take the side of the backend developers here, although a have done a lot of frontend, I avoid it like the plague. There are definitely some frontend tasks that are difficult, and most of it is very time consuming. I do not enjoy spending a few hours of my day trying to get 2 columns of elements to line up nicely, and that is unfortunately the type of thing most frontend developers spend their time doing. It‚Äôs not difficult, but you can bash your head for hours which makes it frustrating.
But front end requires a very different skill set. A front end developer deals with making the UI easy to use, visually pleasing, making it work well in anything from phones to 30 inch monitors, mouse, keyboard, touch screen, screen readers, internet explorer. Most back end developers have never even heard of usability testing. Making a good UI is not easy (at least not for me).
Both ends can be as arbitrarily complex as you make it. Depends on what the app is doing. Think about traditional desktop apps - Adobe draw, excel or word etc‚Ä¶. I think most people will agree that these apps are not simple. Believe me they are much harder than your typical backend that is just doing simple CRUD.. Well guess what.. those kind of complex GUI apps can be built in the browser.. Think Google Docs.. Its not just simple forms anymore.. People need to realize that the browser provides for a very rich runtime for the GUI developer. It's not just about picking pretty colours and making things line up - tho‚Äô aesthetics are very important!
Usually it consists solely of designing a single-user UI, while the backend does most of the ‚Äúheavy lifting,‚Äù has to service lots of clients, has to be available & scalable, etc., etc., etc. Lots more things to be done, and to know about, on a whole different scale than simply building a GUI.
While the technical approach to front end is getting more complicated with JS frameworks like React or Vue, the scope of concern is still very narrow. All complicated business logic still resides in the backend. Scalability is still primarily a backend concern. Infrastructure, security, data storage and persistence - all primarily backend concerns.
I studied physics, math and electronics before there was Windows 95. I started design when Adobe products were only on the Mac OS. First forward to Docker containers at the back and ReactJS at the front and I can say I have seen it all.
Front-end development is definitely harder because of the fact it needs mastery of multiple technologies to implement that also keep changing and evolving. If you learn a back-end language (fewer technologies), you are set for many years but with newer technologies evolving each year for the front-end, UI developers need to keep abreast of them and keep learning forever! Front-end developers are more visual with mastery in user-interface design principles and need to have knowledge of back-end, as well. Also, front-end development needs attention-to-detail, patience and a fertile-imagination which many people do not have. All these factors make front-end development a whole lot harder.
It was a common concept 7 or 8 years ago. At that time there were no rich responsive applications, no JavaScript frameworks were frequently in use. At that time th front end means writing HTML and css and using some jQuery plugin. Although I started as back-end developer and I had same concept until I started working with responsive applications and front end frameworks. The front end developer even not used to call developer, they were used to call designers. Then responsive application concept came along with rich JavaScript frameworks that changed the scenario. Now JavaScript is every where and you need to be a very good programmer to use it wisely. One of my previous manager often said that in 2015 even the human will talk in JavaScript.
Front-end development may have fewer dimensions to it. Backend development can vary quite a bit in difficulty. If you are doing a simple RESTful JSON API, it can be quite easy, so much so that it could be automated if technology and languages didn‚Äôt change so much. But when you have to do some complex algorithms, complex locking, high-performance stuff, I think backend development is what generally pushes the limits of programming. Embedded systems, memory-restrictive environments are where you really need all the tricks you can find.
I do both, but I am primarily a backend developer. I have never heard these words from any backend developers. Front end takes a lot of work. In older systems, you could use visual tools to help aid in yhe design of front end interfaces, but modern day front end development requires just as much coding as backend, but with a lot more what-ifs to dwal with. A backend developer deals only with knowns, frontend developers deal with knowns and unknowns. Back end developers create very simple, APIs to talk to the backend. Front end developera deal with multiple conpatibility quirks depending on all the possible client side environments.
I am yet to meet such a backend developer. From where I live, I always see backend developers hold front end developers in high esteem since it requires not only technical expertise but also a sense of aesthetics, beauty and style. A combination of tech and art skills that are rare to find. Front end engineering includes UX design. There is at least some merit to the argument that with an intuitive and well thought UX even a crappy backend implementation might get success. The other way is not that common.
You need a lot of experience and creative thinking to become good in either role. The front-end will make or break a site. A well designed, intuitive front-end will make a site easy to use and will perform well. That is not a tired cliche ‚Äî a website with those qualities will keep users engaged and on your site longer. Which in turn, results in more revenue generated for the company, whether it be from ads or more sales. So the front-end is under enormous pressure. On the back end, your objectives are clearly defined, with only a limited set of correct possibilities (ie, there is usually only one correct way to interact with an API or to interact with a database, for example). There is no room for debate, either your code is correct or it isn't. That is not the case on the front-end, and that isn't even taking into account the challenges of cross browser and platform compatibility. So in that respect at least, the back end is actually easier.
Frontend tho‚Ä¶ you see a mistake which is most of time just visual thing that can be fixed by CSS / JS. It does not corrupt anything that is really revelant for system health because the care of data consistency never comes from frontend code. You can totally ignore value checks at frontend side as it‚Äôs backend role to keep everything in place.
If you look at it from a time and effort perspective, I would say that the development of front-end could be so frustrating and time consuming, it should have good UI and UX, it should have highly polished visuals, it should work across browsers and display sizes and each browser and display size and renderer has it‚Äôs own implementation (no appropriate generalizations) and front-end tools are not very good or consistent, sometimes a front-end dev could spend an hour just to bring an element in the center of the screen which works correctly across their target browsers.
Back in August I had a client that I was trying to help out of their legal woes on accessibility failings, and their IT manager and Marketing director fought me at EVERY turn with the outright manure they had been shoveling onto everything. FINALLY I get their site into complaince and their cases settled, and NOT EVEN A WEEK LATER those two arseclowns undid every single bit of it pissing on the semantics, graceful degradation, and every other aspect of accessibility with their typical half-assed half-witted mouth-breathingly dumbass bootcrap, CSR using react, and every other blasted thing I told them not to do.
I am a full stack developer but my way of doing things is far different than any of what you guys are doing it seems. I started doing this first learning python which is masterful at text manipulation. As I begin to learn how to do the back end in no SQL, SQL, and later express, and flask, it dawned on me that there is a single unifying factor among all of these things and that is this: it is all text. As a result, the more I began to master the front end, the backend, and the business logic layer, I simply begin to create Python code to generate text templates for all of these things quite easily. My Python code, once it is run, asks me but a simple few questions and then it produces huge amounts of complex code written in whatever language I want. I see everybody else struggling and I‚Äôm thinking wow, if only you guys learn python you could just do what I‚Äôm doing and generate that boiler plate code easily in so many variations. It EASILY creates my HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, React.js, Express, PHP, buttons, forms‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs NOTHING it cannot handle. My most complex Artificial Intelligence code, at the end of the day is just text, so I simply create python template for that‚Ä¶ now I have slain the beast of ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù by writing code that writes the complex code within SECONDS. It can handle even producing a complete website including downloading everything in the correct directories and files. I literally spend every day just creating templates that produce all my code. I hope this will help somebody out there because well I hear people spending weeks on a project, I bet those same people would see my system and want to faint when I‚Äôm able to produce that within a few minutes. Of course, I also understand all the details of how to tweak said code after it is generated so that I only use it to generate massive templated systems that I can expand to modify for whatever use case I want! Go python, Javascript, and Node.js!
Front-end developers have different kind of concerns, especially with how a lot of the user experience is in UI functionality; however, by comparison their stress is like worrying about children running with forks, while back-end developers is like worrying about transporting nitroglycerine in buggies. A back-end developer can become an experienced front-end developer in just a few weeks with proper books/training, it will take months-to-years for a front-end developer to be an experienced back-end developer.
Well, the frontend is always the same tools: javascript (or typescript which is pretty similar), HTML, CSS, a JavaScript Framework (nowadays almost always React, Angular or Vue) and maybe a CSS library. On the other hand there are more varieties of tools in the backend, first of all you have like 50 languages, and you better learn at least 4 backend languages if you don‚Äôt want to have a hard time looking for a job. Besides, the backend has more chances to work with things like security, data science, and some other mathematical heavy stuff.
The other reason some may think so is because frontend commonly uses javascript, and javascript is an interpreted language which does not fully implement the patterns of an Object Oriented Language.
Frontend has grown increasingly complex for different reasons, but one of the major ones is that the design patterns for managing state and propagating state changes has seen a multitude of design solutions over time, and therefore also frameworks and libraries to try out and keep up with. This is no different for either web development (JS), iOS (Swift) or Android (Java / Kotlin) native. I have to acknowledge that it sometimes is very attractive to get lost in convoluted theories about the design in the decision making process (it‚Äôs not because you can, that you always should).
But, debugging code in frontend is often tricky and more complicated, because of rudimentary debugging tools in the browser (often Chrome with dev.extension is used for that). When I was ‚Äúfullstack‚Äù dev, I remember it took days to find a bug in the frontend code, while on the backend it‚Äôs often not that hard.
Backend developers say that frontend is easier because the coding behind it is usually more straight forward. However, one side is not easier or harder than the other. It might seem counter intuitive after reading my first sentence so I‚Äôll clarify. Backend developers tend to forget that frontend is not just about code and frameworks. A frontend developer will have to code to some extent but he will also have to do some UI/UX design, some optimisations and so on.
otally not true. Backend is way easier than frontend. Any backend developer usually just need to know one language like python or java to create an API service while frontend developer need to know CSS, HTML, JavaScript or Typescript for the frameworks. Some websites may even need frontend devs that knows photoshop, or even 3D modelling.
A backend developer has a nice stable environment, he can usually even configure the server that he runs on. A Frontend developer needs to make his one codebase work in multiple OS‚Äôs, dozens of browsers on hundredths of screens and thousands of devices, in an environment where there are wildly different performance characteristics, standards compliances - not to mention multiple input methods, which often are not reliably detectable, accessibility, graceful degradation‚Ä¶
You are going to have two choices. They have been identified. Scrape the data, or use the API. If you use the API you need to make sure you are not hitting against any limitations in usage that may hinder your collection. It is possible that you may want to automate your collection into your spreadsheet with tools that are designed for screen scraping. I can't make a recommendation without knowing a lot more about the situation. I would through Amazon's Mechanical Turk into the mix as a manual cost effective way of scraping this data initially.
JSON file is a normal text file, you can open it with any text editor, I will recommend Notepad++ as it is a very convenient notepad like app that supports color coding for many file formats and also have convenient plugins for formatting the files
The real question here however is "what is JSON?" JSON is JavaScript object notation, or a series of JavaScript objects with listed attributes. These attributes are what are listed inside of each set of curly brackets, and provide information about the object. JSON files may contain multiple objects in each file, and may be the result of a data dump from a program that uses JSON notation, or a means by which a user can enter information into a database. MongoDB, for example, natively uses JSON to store data.
JSON is a textual data format and notation with a quite simple specification (despite the name it has few connections to JavaScript, except some common lexical tokens; also recent JavaScript standards define standard JSON parser functions in the standard library; but JSON is not a Turing-complete programming language like JavaScript is; so you cannot code Euclidean algorithm in JSON, but you could code it in JavaScript). So you can open a JSON file with any text editor (such as emacs or vim). That does not mean you‚Äôll understand that file (JSON is a data format, and each application would have its own conventions about how to use that format). You may want to use jq on the command line to process some JSON files.
A .json file represents some JSON - Wikipedia and can be opened and read with any text editor. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is used to serialize data; however, now JSON is used widely outside of JavaScript in server-client applications to transmit data over HTTP. If all you want to do is read it, any text editor should do fine. Sites like Best JSON Formatter and JSON Validator: Online JSON Formatter will also help you format and validate the data to make it more readable.
It depends on how big that JSON file is. If it‚Äôs a relatively small dataset, you can simply read the file, deserialize it, then programmatically search for whatever you are looking for. If the dataset is large, you may want to look into storing the data in a database like mongodb/elasticsearch and then querying it.
There is no such thing as a json file. You may have a file with a .json ending on it but it‚Äôs just a text file. json stands for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Basically, it‚Äôs a standardized text representation of a data object (array or hash or whatever) structure. So the big and real question is what do you want to do with this data? If you just want to look at it then any application that can read a text file will work - even ‚Äòcat‚Äô. If you want to incorporate that data into another application or otherwise manipulate the data in a useful way that‚Äôs a different, and more complicated, question.
Lets say we have a browser written in python, and a web server written in java. Lets assume that both these processes dealing with similar objects e.g. a dictionary in python and a Hashmap in java. The only possible way for these two processes to communicate the object data is by serializing their respective structures into a neutral format that both understand, and this is JSON.
JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation ) is a lightweight web standard language that we use to structure and communicate data over a network. Before this data communications were done over XML but JSON is much more light weight. It‚Äôs based on JavaScript, and all it is are objects with name value pairs. ex: { ‚Äúthis‚Äù: ‚Äúthat‚Äù }
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format and is currently supported by nearly every major programming language. Unlike XML, it is very easy to read and write, and uses conventions familiar to programmers of C-like languages.
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. For example, you are writing a Javascript application which talks to a web service to get information about an object, the object could be returned in JSON notation.
Old school programmers - they belong to a strict discipline of programming, where before you start coding you have to learn computer science, logic, basic algorithms theory, mathematics and a lots of other things. Then you have to read documentation of a programming language, so you will know basic syntax, structure, proper methods and so on. They have spent YEARS in that way and their knowledge is something more than incredible.
Using Stack Overflow at Google would be encouraged if it were possible. Unfortunately, one of the biggest downsides of working here is that Stack Overflow is useless. You‚Äôre forced to use secret internal versions of everything, and because of the secrecy, there‚Äôs no help for you on external sites. There are attempts at internal analogs, but there just aren‚Äôt enough users to make them useful
The service supports both document submission and web crawling, for processing both private document collections & internet-facing content. Extracted meta-data is returned in a variety of formats including XML, JSON, and RDF. Support for linked data is also provided, connecting your content to relevant entries in Freebase, Wikipedia, CIA World Factbook, etc.
The main difference with this API is that is open-source so feel free to use the code. It‚Äôs also hosted in Mashape so there are several SDKs available for: Python, PHP, Java, Node, Objective-c, Ruby .NET or CURL.
Multilingual Dictionaries: Upload and edit your dictionaries. Search within SYSTRAN multilingual dictionaries, obtain translations with additional contextual information such as frequency of meanings, domains and contexts, expressions and examples, the search can also be done within your own dictionaries
RussianSentimentAnalyzer is a JSON API based on the technology stack of SemanticAnalyzer company. It is capable of parsing the input text, reconstructing the meaning of messages with typos, like tweets and finding a sentiment polarity oriented towards a particular object. Consider an example: I like new GalaxyS, but do not enjoy new iPhone. If there are no objects, the sentiment of this sentence can be detected as NEUTRAL or MIXED. If, however, GalaxyS has been passed in as an object, the sentiment will be POSITIVE. It will be NEGATIVE for iPhone in this particular example. Currently the API supports Russian language with input texts varying from long formal news posts to informal and short tweets.
Quality of NLP phrase extraction / classification results is superb - TextRazor uses Freebase and DBpedia (among other repositories) and this allows TextRazor to classify / categorize / extract PHRASES such as "computer security" - correctly as one entity (and not as many other APIs - incorrectly classifying this example as one class of "computer" AND another class as "security"). Programmatic control over which terms TextRazor will use and which ones will not - is again, very simple.
Thus, WhatsApp does have a WhatsApp Business API, and 60+ WhatsApp Business Service Provider (BSPs) and ISVs(Independent Software Vendors) like AiSensy providing instantaneous approval for WhatsApp API to businesses.
Several companies around the world could benefit on developing customer service apps through WhatsApp. I understand that "bulk messaging to anyone" should be denied ever. But replying to people that talk to you (or sending alerts to people that have talked at least once with you) should be always fine. I believe this piece (talking with your customers, starting a conversation replying to them) is vital and will be very welcome by thousands of developers around the globe.
Whatsapp has opened up their APIs. They have been slowly opening up their apis with direct channel to companies. It‚Äôs kind of a beta rollout where they give access to select companies to use their service. I think Makemytrip uses their apis to send transactional messages based on messages that my friends have received. With my limited knowledge, few other companies in India are integrating their apis currently. The apis allow you to send and receive messages without any template validation. There is a way to get the template validated but the result I‚Äôm not truly sure. I think if the templates are validated like transactional messages, it would be hard to mark the sender as spam (but the last statement is an assumption).
WhatsApp is secure, trustworthy and hence is preferred over the globe over other messaging applications. Having an API (application programming interface) will make it vulnerable to 3 party access which may in turn compromise with user privacy and end to end encryption.
Because if they gave out their API someone would make a client for Linux, Mac and Windows which uses the whatsapp network without the requisite of owning a smartphone. And whatsapp can‚Äôt let that happen. Their popularity DEPENDS on forcing people to own a smartphone.
Unless WhatsApp team provides a public API to use their services, there can never be a legal way of using it. But the question is making it secure (end to end encryption) as well as giving access to use the same service in a bit of a problem, this might be the reason for not giving out an API.
JS (or JavaScript) is a programming language that is used in web browsers whereas JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to format or serialize data such that it can be stored or used in network communication between a server and an application.
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is basically a text format that makes it easy to share data between devices such as Clients and Servers. Its Origin is based on how JavaScript object works so in that sense, it is related/close to but not completely JavaScript Object. Regardless of the fact that it has its origin from JavaScript, it is widely used across many Languages like C, Ruby, Python, PHP just to mention a few. Because of the size and easiness to convert to a data structure, it is kind of a great alternative to other formats like XML.
JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organised, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
Javascript is a language with a full syntax to perform operations and statements. Even though the programming style is quite different, Javascript could theoretically do the same job as Java, C, Python or any other general purpose programming language, though each have their own strengths and drawbacks that may force you to write in completely different ways to achieve the same task. Not to mention the environment each language usually is executed in.
JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is the data interchange format means we can store the data in key: value pairs, value can be any of this types (Object, Array, String, Boolean, Number, Null). This is mainly used between the client and server data communication over http and can be used any were inside the client or server for transmitting the data from one point to another in the user readable fromat.
JSON is a data interchange format, which just happens to look like a subset of YAML or JavaScript code you can execute and get an object back. A JavaScript object is just an object in JavaScript.
However, I would suggest you look at converting you data files to some other format (if at all possible). It would be very beneficial if you constantly have to refer to random objects inside that file instead of just running through the file from beginning to end each time. Really look at using a real database instead of just a markup text file like JSON/XML, it would use a lot less RAM and be orders of magnitude faster. Depending on your exact requirements you could even use some non-SQL databases which work on top of JSON (e.g. MongoDB uses binary JSON called BSON and include indexing for faster random access).
I'm a recent JSON convert, and having spent 10 years in the woods of XML, the one benefit I see to XML is the ability to define a schema via XSD, and then validate an XML document against it. The XSD schema definitions were particularly useful in SOAP based web service development, since you were able to generate local classes based off of the schema dictated in the XSD.
XML is a much richer format for structuring data that can and has been used in a very large range of applications. Many online and networked and industrial applications have standards for tag, attribute, and other entities associated with their applications; which supports the business and engineering processes. XML (in what was once called "strict HTML" or XSL transformed XML) can also be used directly in web-pages simply by adding the entire XML structure to the DOM, and there are simple DOM extraction methods in JavaScript for accessing data.
Frankly? Same shit, different pile. It's more compact, but all the curly brackets are less readable. Json-schema, while it has some elegance to it, upon a close look is amateurish compared to XSD. Lots of underdeveloped dark and dusty corners in that spec and it's less declarative in nature which is makes it less suitable to meta-data driven systems.
I am going to assuming that you asking about advantages of each format in the context of an ajax response. The biggest advantage for me is that JSON ends up being much, much easier to traverse, identify, and read nodes than XML. XML methods are cumbersome and long to write, while JSON is much more cruft and simple.
Simpler is better is my motto, for that reason I like JSON for programming in Python because it correlates well with the way I think of dictionaries in Python. The simplejson library is rather easy to use. XML can get a bit annoying to parse using python's available libraries.
Well, having mastered HTML and CSS and thence having bagged a high-paying Front-End Web Development job fresh out of college at Airbnb(US $94,100), by showcasing to the recruiters my command over the various aspects of Web Development including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, by the means of my developed project, I believe I should put an answer to this question so as to make your learning less troublesome than mine.
A text editor. You can use the one that comes preloaded in your computer. In Windows it's Notepad or Wordpad, in Ubuntu it's gedit and I think Mac has TextMate. I personally use Sublime Text because it's really nice on my eyes. You could use Notepad++ or Dreamweaver(which is a paid one) or anything that suits you. There is a myriad of text editors online. I think most people use the ones I've mentioned here.
The best way to learn Web Designing Coding that is HTML and CSS are a lot like you can join any Educational institution or if u have less time or shortage of time you can learn Online Also by joining a good institution if you are looking for best institute in the field of web designing. I highly recommend you to join DG Royals Institute which is located at GTB Nagar Delhi.
Think of a purpose. Why do you want to learn JavaScript after HTML and CSS? Why do you even want to learn HTML and CSS? Do you want to become a web developer? Do you want to spend time building the way websites look, or do you want to spend time working on the back end, what makes a website really work?
Starting with HTML is one of the easiest way in order to learn code or Programming. There are a lot of resources, Online course, video tutorial, blogs etc. Start learning HTML/CSS from video tutorials or online course , this should be best for a beginner. It will take 5‚Äì6 hour per day then you can learn it in a month. The basic for HTML can be learned in two or three days.
Then I got familiar with SOLOLEARN. The thing I loved there is after learning a topic we have to answer the question which makes learning more efficient,easy and interesting.I used to challenge others from which I could find the topics on which I needed to work upon.
Well, if you wants to learn HTML and CSS then I think you want to learn about Web Development which is pretty cool. In Web Development, HTML and CSS are the starting pillars. While HTML creates the basic structure of Webpage, CSS deals with the designing part of the webpage. So, what are the best ways and resources to learn these awesome web technologies.
It may take you 1-2 weeks to complete the course, and about a month of practice to get comfortable with HTML and CSS. The key is to apply your learning and build projects. The easiest project you can create is your own personal website.
Here‚Äôs the thing, just learning HTML tags won‚Äôt get you anywhere. You can google and get all the tags you need but then what are you going to do with those? After you learn HTML and CSS you should be able to convert a website layout that is in the format of an image into a code. The best approach is to implement a small project.
It is entirely a new Language for beginners. So to understand its working one should atleat understand in some beginner training/ coaching center as they will provide the code editors and introduce it to you. If you directly try to learn it through reading books or internet, you may get confuse and loose your interest. So basic clarity can be achieved in any institute.
But what helped the most was to do the two most basic things when it comes to learning. I read a lot of source code via GitHub and I make a lot of projects. You can start out by making the most simple project you can think of and work up from there, but programming is one of those things where you can only read so much from a book before it doesn't do anything. You HAVE to start building ASAP.
You can also learn from FreeCodeCamp but it will only get you started with the syntax etc. After that, you have to learn the rest yourself. All these coding websites like Codecademy, FCC, CodeSchool will get you only started. Hence, don't rely on them if you want to master coding.
Whilst completing those courses, always experiment; break open a text editor and play around with things (Sublime is great), break stuff and see whats going on. See a website you like? Right click and inspect element/view page source. Copy & steal code to understand how they get things to work. Remember to experiment and always have fun!
You can find some tutorial videos about making websites -there are many on youtube- and follow the explanations along with writing the code. Learning by actually building a real website will be much more efficient than only reading some "theoretical" books. After finishing building your 'simple' Html/css website, then you can play with it, customize it the way you like, find and actual use for it; in this process is when you are actually going to learn html/css.
If you are a beginner in Programming, then the best way to learn HTML/CSS is that you suffer on net. Search on the topics and watch as many video tutorials you can. I have the same thing. First i downloaded some of the videos from youtube and then downloaded some ebooks. I loved to watch them and then slowly-slowly I was no more a beginner. Browsing on internet is the best way for a beginner to start programming.
I started learning full stack web development only a few months back. I know the basic tags and styling. It's easy to learn one thing at a time and write a simple code using that thing. But when it comes to building a big project, I faced problems like not being able to handle large lines of code.
Nothing beats practice, the more you do it the sooner you'll be good at it. It's also important you take a site and try to build one exactly like that, for example you should try - HTML5 UP HTML template and try to replicate them. I know these are tough ones but you'll learn so many things from doing these template than anything else. Remember harder project will help you learn faster. And if you're stuck on anything rape the Google button for it. Stackoverflow will be your friend this entire time. Happy learning.
Like User said, you're going to need more than 6 days, but I think a good place to start is Codecademy. They have pretty good HTML and CSS tutorials, and their JavaScript tutorial is okay if you have experience. There are tons of other tutorials sites, but I personally learned on Codecademy.
It is a Language used to write web pages, what ever you see on any website, it has been written in HTML. It is used to make a basic structure of any website, like Ashwin Sharan said it acts as the skeleton for any web page. The images you see, the paragraphs, headings, columns, whatever, it is all written in HTML. Learning HTML is the first step towards web designing.
HTML is one of the structured language, HTML is also called HyperText Markup Language. It is used for designing web pages. We can understand this language easily. Without high experience, we can do work by using HTML language. Html consists of tags. By using tags we can design the web page. Mainly the structure of HTML is, first we will be started by <html> tag and <head> in that <title> and<body> tag. We can close the tags by the ‚Äò/‚Äô symbol like</html>,</head>,</title> and </body>.
HTML is case insensitive with its language commands. The characters within the document, however, are case sensitive. The language consists of various "tags" which are known as elements. These allow the browser to understand (and put into the desired/specified format) the layout, background, headings, titles, lists, text and/or graphics on the page. The elements are classified according to their function in the HTML document.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It is used to describe the structure of Web pages using markup.
HTML(Hyper text markup language). HTML is a basiclanguage for crating web page. It's easy to learn and understand with CSS ( Cascaded style sheet). In any editor(notepad,notepad++ etc.) we write the html code after writing html code save with .html extension in your Pc. And after that we can see HTML page in browser(chrome). Now HTML5 is the latest version. It is a new version of a HTML. CSS3(latest version) and HTML5 both works together.
HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web ‚Äî by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear ‚Äî i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links ‚Äî there is no set order to do things in.
HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that your Internet browser can display them as they are planned to look. Without HTML, a browser would do not understand how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. HTML acts as a bone (structure) of a web page, and CSS acts as its skin (appearance).
When writing HTML, you add "tags" to the text in order to create thestructure. These tags tell the browser how to display the text or graphics in the document. For example, the following document has a simple layout (structure). Notice there are three major parts: a heading, two paragraphs and a bulleted list.
HTML is one of the three main components of the web alongside CSS and JavaScript, that are used to primarily develop web pages and web applications which run on web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Almost all web applications use HTML because it is the only language which browsers understand and render on the computer screen.
The teachings of basic HTML code can (almost) be broken down in two all-ruling disciplines: style a.k.a manipulating the appearance, and referring, a.k.a marking and pointing to locations of, and within documents. HTML can‚Äôt do anything more complicated than drawing a table, or creating frames.
HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the ¬ª W3C, the organization charged with designing and maintaining the language.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is generally the basis for all the webpages you see today. It defines elements on a webpage and tells browsers what to display, how to display it, and where. This very page you're viewing now (To be very general), after some processing by the web server and your browser, is HTML.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hyper Text being what we now call links. It is usually in a file with an extension of .htm or .html. HTML is a protocol that uses text to describe how a webpage should look and what it should say. That is a basic answer and when HTML and the web as we know it today were new it was a completely accurate. Today there are other languages such as Javascript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and others that influence how HTML performs.
Basically, an HTML document is a plain text file. It contains rich text.The rich text means text with tags.Any HTML program can be written in simple Notepad or WordPad text editors.The extension to this program should be either html or htm. this program then can be opened in some web browser and the corresponding web page can be viewed.
HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is used for the base data structure and layout for a website. It is also related to the similar XML (Extensible Markup Language). While XML is often used to store very complex data structures on servers, HTML serves as the base template for any website. The base HTML for any website is based below‚Ä¶
HTML is hyper text markup language. this language is very simple and easy to learn. all web pages are written in HTML. as the name suggests this is a markup language and does not involve variables, loops or arrays. various language such as vbscript, php, css, javascript work along with html, as a part of html. the latest version of html is HTML5. To study html you can refer "HTML AND CSS" BY jhon ducket.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web browser page. The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and images for the user. Each individual markup code is referred to as an element (but many people also refer to it as a tag). Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.
HTML stands for Hyper-text markup language is a language that is used by the web pages to display any content in a web browser. Web pages follow the rules of HTML in order to be displayed correctly in a Web browser. HTML syntax is based on list of tags that decide the page format and describe what is displayed on the web page. In simple word we can understand that HTML is a language that is used to create documents on the world wide web.
If each website is an identity, search engines like Google are like doctors, perhaps in the early days of modern medicine, trying to better diagnose site's inner workings, much like organs in our body. Through these efforts they are able to better understand a site, and measure it against other similar sites.
HTML basically stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is not a programming language that is used to solve a problem but it is a markup language. HTML is used to create an user interface in the web application. This language is used to create static pages with attractive and interactive stuffs that will make user easily access web application. This is linked with other things like MySQL that links web page and server and like php that is used for coding server side programs. This HTML has inbuilt tags that have to be utilized in creative way. There are many software like adobe Muse cc that will help you create website creatively within minutes but I suggest you to sit and code. HTML coding is referred to as front end coding or as client side coding. The server side coding is called as back end. HTML is mother of all web applications in short...!! Learn it, enjoy it...!!
HTML : This is the basic need of a web page. Html is a language which browser understands. It is used for the basic building prototype of a web application. It helps you to place content on a webpage wherever and however you want.Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
Hyper Text Marup Language commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language usede to create web pages. Along with CSS, and javascript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.
HTML stands for ‚ÄúHyper Text Markup Language‚Äù which used for creating a webpage. It is used for tags for designing a web page. Two different types of tags are used, one is the opening tag (<>) and the second is closing tag (). Some tags are paired and some unpaired, Pair tags are known as combination of opening and closing tags and unpaired tags only used for opening tags. This file saves with .html extension. HTML is the language that describes the structure and the semantic content of a web document. Content within a web page is tagged with HTML elements such as <img>, <title>, <p>, <div>, <picture>, and so forth. These elements form the building blocks of a website.

if u want to learn any Programing Language then you should have knowledge of HTML.
HTML is a formal Recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by the major browsers, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Navigator, which also provide some additional non-standard codes. The current version of HTML is HTML 4.0. However, both Internet Explorer and Netscape implement some features differently and provide non-standard extensions. Web developers using the more advanced features of HTML 4 may have to design pages for both browsers and send out the appropriate version to a user. Significant features in HTML 4 are sometimes described in general as dynamic HTML. What is sometimes referred to as HTML 5 is an extensible form of HTML called Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML).

The correct structure for an HTML document starts with <HTML><HEAD>(enter here what document is about)<BODY> and ends with </BODY></HTML>. All the information you'd like to include in your Web page fits in between the <BODY> and </BODY> tags.

HTML is a markup language for creating webpages and web applications. It makes the content of webpages and layout is generally done by CSS.Javascript is used to increase the user interactivity.Consider HTML as a body which is fleshed out by CSS and JavaScript makes it sing and dance.
It means HyperText Markup Language. It was originally developed from SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which was a ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù for describing the content of documents. HTML is the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù for describing the content (and in some cases behavior) of hypertext documents, the general documents you see when you visit a web page.
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It elements are the building blocks of web content. HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript make web more user friendly and interactive. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
Very basics of HTML are tags, came from XML and became a standard marking tool for displaying information in web browser. Together with CSS former XML tags compose a new technology that we call HTML today. Browsers had a little different engines but mostly they support HTML the same way, so basic tags and CSS principles work everywhere.
HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.HTML is also used as the document format of offline (stored on your computer) help and documentation bundled with the applications installed on your computer . When you activate a application help ,typically via its help menu or a question mark icon .
HTML can embed applications written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content material of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content material. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML on account that 1997.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark Up Language. HTML is mainly used for designing web sites. Commands like bg color, font etc help in creating visually creative web pages. It also comprises of some special features like marquee effect which helps in scrolling the text on the web pages.
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by tags.
HTML is not a programming language, like C++ or Java. It is a markup language. A markup language is a set of instructions on how to create a document, like a Web page. HTML is also very good at incorporating other types of document into itself, like a Flash file for instance. The web browser, if it has the correct addons/plugins, can show that content easily.
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. These web pages can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.

The idea behind HTML was a modest one. When Tim Berners-Lee was putting together his first elementary browsing and authoring system for the Web, he created a quick little hypertext language that would serve his purposes. He imagined dozens, or even hundreds, of hypertext formats in the future, and smart clients that could easily negotiate and translate documents from servers across the Net.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which has been usually used for making web applications and web pages that in turn, helps in building a dynamic website. HTML is a programming language that allows a user to create a website, which is basically a collection of web pages. HTML is the group of codes and symbols. It is platform independent language that can be used on any platform like Linux and Windows.
Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. ... Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
However, keep in mind that for HTML tags, their job is to indicate the structure of the document rather than how the text is suppose to look; indicating how text is suppose to look is the job of CSS.
HTML stands for Hypertext markup language. It is used to design the basic structure of a webpage. Different components on a website, be it an image, a link or a contact form, everything is a tag in terms of html language. Every website we see today is made up of webpages which are rendered to the users in HTML form.
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for creating a webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. ... HTML was made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are several versions of HTML.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup language. It along with CSS and JavaScript forms the founding stone of the Internet. All web-pages are written in HTML, as this is the language understood by most web-browsers. It is the most essential part, as for a web-page CSS and JS are not essential.
You can create containers that maintain a constant aspect ratio by using padding-bottom as a percentage. The CSS spec says that padding-bottom is defined relative to the *width*, not height, so if you want a 5:1 aspect ratio container you can do something like this
And it's almost certainly faster to use Crockford's json2.js. On older browsers, it might be slower, but safer. On modern browsers, it just falls through to the built-in version. A JSON parser is simpler than a JavaScript parser, so this is probably both faster and safer.
If you inspect an webpage on Firefox using Developer Tool. Click on 3D button will give you a 3D view of all the existing DOM. Use mouse to rotate DOM objects and layers.
If you type in String.prototype into your console, you can see a bunch of old functions you can use to wrap the text in HTML tags (some deprecated HTML obviously):'foo'.italics()
By setting the font-size of the <body> (which by default its 16px) to 62.5%, setting em based font-sizes for the rest of the page becomes very simple. just divide the intended pixel size by 10 to get the equivalent size in ems.
In web development, a polyfill (or polyfiller) is downloadable code which provides facilities that are not built into a web browser. It implements technology that a developer expects the browser to provide natively, providing a more uniform API landscape.
In webkit `$0` is the selected DOM element. Rather than grabbing the css path to query for an element using jQuery you can simply find the thing in the elements tab and type `$0` in the console for access to that HTML element.
Use download attribute with file download links, like: <a href="fileurl" download="report.pdf">download></a> when you need to place download link on your site. Without download attribute backend developer have to add some special HTTP-headers to response in order to start downloading process. Also, you can specify user-friendly filename (like 'report.doc', 'cv.pdf', etc), when you store files with long, unreadable names.
window.setTimeout(function(){},0) actually takes ~10-20 ms, if you want to yield but run immediately after, you can use window.postMessage and add a listener to run the function. (Note: I've been corrected in the comments that its more like 4 ms now, but this method is still faster when you really need the speed boost).
I recently discovered that I can set the URL bar in the browser to something else. This is useful if you are calling an internal URL in your application, but want that your users use another URL for public sharing.
You can assign a core JS function into another variable to preserve a reference to it, overwrite the core function with your own and call the original one inside your custom function.
I think <datalist> tag is interesting and not well known. This tag specifies a list of predefined options for an <input> element. The <datalist> tag is used to provide an "autocomplete" feature on <input> elements. Users will see a drop-down list of pre-defined options as they input data.
This is very useful in making the browser history work for ajax powered apps, as well as making its links shareable. See it in action when your browsing the source on Github.com.
If you just want to log something each time a particular line of code is executed without changing the source code (say, when debugging a production server), you can add a conditional breakpoint in that line, with the condition console.log(whatever)&&false which always evaluates to false so the breakpoint never stops the execution, but the `whatever` part gets logged to the console.
In the inspector, you can not only edit the elements and the css. You can also copy or cut and paste elements - very useful for mocking stuff up or rearranging structure on the fly, even during client presentations.
I always like to start coding right away with a simple html, but usually is time-consuming when you need to prep your HTML with links and files; especially for javascripts and css.
MutationObserver gives you a JavaScript callback for DOM changes; Mozilla just removed the "experimental" icon this week after I pinged them on twitter. The object/function is exactly what I was looking for, and it is supported in "all" browsers.
Adding a line that says "debugger;" anywhere in your JS code sets a breakpoint and drops you into the interactive debugger at that point in the code. (I've only tried webkit dev tools, but I imagine IEs newer dev tools may support it as well)
One of my favorite tricks that I find myself using all the time involves maintaining an aspect ratio that will scale with the browser width. Often this is used for video iframes, but it also works wonders for images.
It was too many years before I learned that the simplest way to clear a single (or series of) floated element(s) was to simply declare overflow:hidden on the parent element. Saves me a lot of hassle - no extra markup, no css :after-content declarations.
Most modern web devs don't realize the hoops we used to have to jump through in order to get a web page to not only have decently semantic markup but also make it look consistent across all prominent Windows browsers at the time (IE6, IE4-5.5, Netscape Navigator 4, AOL IE) to a given static design image (usually a render of a PSD), including but not limited to
In WebKit (and probably IE), every ID property in the DOM is accessible as a global variable in JavaScript, although it's not the fastest way of accessing an element by its ID.
For starters, jQuery makes it extremely easy to manipulate the DOM. In order to make a web app more interactive, web developers manipulate the DOM & jQuery makes it very easy to do that
Google for "web developer" jobs and read what employers mostly seek. If you want to continue mostly as a frontend dev, than oyu should consider frontend JS frameworks as Angular.js, React.js, Bootstrap, Sass, Less, Grunt, Bower, Canvas. Always build something that seems impossible to build from your position.
Javascript is the hottest language right now. I would be patient and stick with Javascript till you become intermediate or advanced. After you become intermediate or advanced with javascript become an expert on JQuery. Build a good 5 to 10 websites using JQuery so you learn all the shortcuts of javascript.
Excel - Open an Excel spreadsheet and create a column called Technologies and another column titled In Demand. Each time you look at a job listing you will see a list of required technologies for that job. Write down the technology (HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, JavaScript, Angular JS, etc...) in the technology column the first time you encounter it and add a 1 to the in demand column. If you come across a technology you've already added to your list increase the in demand count by +1
Web designer,1. AngularJs: This is one of the most popular javascript frameworks.Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.You can play with front end element with angular js.
Static website : It includes web pages which are client sided and static , which means they don't change and are actually just built with front end programming languages such as HTML, CSS and probably JS.
JavaScript, on the other hand, is used pretty much everywhere, on sites that use Bootstrap and sites that don't. It's also the language used in the increasingly popular server Node.JS, which uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine. Knowing Javascript also unlocks doors to a myriad of other helpful tools like REACT, and powerful ways to extend existing web sites.
Jquery is a JavaScript library. The more JS you know when you start using it, the less dependent you'll be on its "magic". JavaScript developers who don't seem to know how to do anything without jquery are not very highly regarded.
I would highly recommend begging a project, but plan the skills you will need to complete it. Build the things you can with HTML, CSS and JS. Make a checklist of them and then learn them one by one and at the same time begin to incorporate those skills into your website until you have a finished project that you are happy with.
They are all just tools that you can use to build stuff. It‚Äôs not difficult to learn to use a hammer, but it‚Äôs difficult to learn to build a house. You can know full specifications of HTML, CSS or JS‚Äîit would be useless if you do not know how to use them.
By leaning TypeScript you can easily start learning new AngularJs 2 Framework. AngularJS 2 now in beta will be for sure in the futur the best framework for developing frontend. You can also start learning nodejs for backend and when you are ready you can pick up frameworks like LoopbackJS or Meteor.
Assuming that you have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (instantiation patterns, data structures, finding 'this', and understand a decent amount of common quirks you'll run into while writing in JavaScript) you should really look into learning an MVC framework. The one you choose to start with is not quite as important as understanding how the model, view, and controller communicate with one another. A list of some popular MVCs
What is the reason that have made you want to learn programming? It's best to have some sort of goal or objective. For example, I have a couple of app and retro game ideas that I am going to work on once I become more knowledgable [I am currently learning programming as well]. If you are having a hard time coming up with a project I suggest going to hackathons. That'll be a great way to put your skills to the test and you'll learn a ton from other people.
Backend languages such as PHP, NodeJS, Ruby, Python, etc. And a front end framework: React, Angular, Vue. With Node.js and a front end framework you could branch off into Gatsby or Next.js for super fast websites
HTML, CSS and JS are used to develop the interface of the website. But you are still lagging behind at the back end part without which, the knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS is not worth it.
Imagine a carpenter who is hired by a homeowner to build a ‚Äústructure‚Äù in their backyard, with little information provided about the fi nal project. The carpenter needs to know the purpose of the structure. Do they want a shed? A bandstand? A garage? Just as structures have different purposes, so do websites. As a designer you should be able to defi ne, or have the client defi ne, the goal of the website in a simple sentence. For example, in this book, you will be designing a site called SmoothieWorld, which has the following goal
Try learning php along with MySql as a database which helps you make a dynamic webpage and would help you to interact with data which you might require or related to your work of website which you create. Happy building website :)
Learn Javascript so that you can add functionality to your web page. PHP is outdated and people who use PHP are frowned upon. But Javascript is a must, for web development.
So try to build a simple project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the framework, library or technology to learn will stir from this simple project.
If you want to be a full stack developer then you should have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that will help you a lot in development as well.
Have a look at the list. The subset appearing in both the lists are Java and Python. In my experience, knowledge of these 2 languages increases desirability of candidates. Javascript is an axiliary skill unless you are a front end developer, for others at least some knowledge of javascript is necessary.Having said that, salary of a software engineer doesn‚Äôt depend on the knowledge of programming languages. It depends on your abilitiy to find solutions. Because you wouldn‚Äôt be the only Java/Python coder in your company. What gives you leverage is your solutions. So try to build something with your knowledge of HTML+CSS+Javascript+Python/Java.
You should build something because you‚Äôve likely learned nothing. I‚Äôve been responsible for thousands of websites being built. I never once asked anyone what I should learn next. Nor did I ever say I‚Äôve learned HTML,CSS, JavaScript‚Ä¶ I just built things using them. I still learn new things almost every time I build a new project.
I would say focus more on javascript. First just learn the language completely. Get handy with its libraries. Learn front end frameworks ( any will work). Learn node and pick a JS backend framework.
After that, you must learn more of Javascript and be familiar with its ecosystem of libraries and frameworks especially jQuery . Then learn Grid tools, and front end frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap and Foundation. Also some CSS Preprocessor like sass and less. When you are done with that, come back and will tell you the next step
It depends on what you want to do. If you want to build web apps, learn Ruby and Rails. If you want to run a forum or something, PHP is your best bet. You can build on your skills and become a kick-ass front-end developer. The possibilities are endless.
It doesn‚Äôt really matter which language you learn. Learn one you like, or one your friends know so that you can get help. You have 2 good directions now. You could learn JavaScript and add some cool front end functionality or learn a backend language and add databases and stuff. Either is good, and which language dosen‚Äôt really matter. If you like php learn php. But do learn the new version.
In the long run you‚Äôll probably decide you would rather do web development with Ruby or Python, but if you start looking at PHP with WordPress you‚Äôll get a feel for how the server side of the web works without a lot of the mysterious behaviors you‚Äôll bang your head against with those higher-level frameworks. PHP is very C-like so it won‚Äôt seem alien since you already know some JS. What you learn there will translate to almost any other programming language you choose to learn.
You know HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I assume you might go with web development in the long run. I will suggest to take a look at simplest Python web server Flask (A Python Microframework). You will be up and running in minutes.
Seriously, people underestimate how difficult this is. You can go up or down a level as you wish. Up a level with framework abstractions. Down a level to to browser specific optimization. Learn about how to use the profiler to debug memory leak. Learn SVG and canvas and WebGL.
Practically, to keep moving forward with your ability to create sites now, learn jQuery and Bootstrap too. They will help you professionally and as you continue to push forward in your path to mastering the world of the web, knowing jquery and bootstrap will inform you of whats going on in javascript and advanced css...giving you more to be curious about.
I would first finish learning JS and then go into something like PHP or jQuery. After that, you probably know what kind of programming you want to do and what you want to make with programming so go on from there by learning languages that you want to use to make cool things like Ruby, Python, or even Swift if you want to go into iOS app development.
If you want to be a UI Engineer then definitely pick up SASS and LESS. It will make your CSS much easier to read.
HTML is used as a markup language deals mainly with tags and CSS is mainly used for styling and if you know a bit of JavaScript you can go for UI development. To become a successful web developer you have to know any of the server side language like PHP which is popular now and you need to know how to get data from database and all those things.
According to multiple study (like this), JavaScript is one of the most popular programming language. For client-side programming, JS has no competition at all. Why not learn Full Stack with JS itself ?
Next, add some interactivity via JavaScript. Make database calls through AJAX. Use jQuery or a similar library to make your JavaScript development easy, rapid, and stable.
Prototyping, Testing and couple of others are missing in that list; but let's be reasonable. Even then, one cannot probably build an average quality enterprise web application alone. A personal/hobby app or something for profile building is definitely possible.
The best way to get involved in something is to start doing it. So, to start Web development is to start from learning HTML, CSS, and then move ahead to bootstrap, javascript, jquery, JSON, PHP, JSP, e.t.c.
JavaScript is literally everywhere. Google's V8 JS engine actually made it possible to run JavaScript code even on IoT devices and some reports prove that the code is almost as performant as C++ code (you better check).
Being a full stack developer is not an easy job, as you have to master lots of technologies for frontend and backend development. There is a list of technologies full stack developers usually use, like LAMP, LAPP, MAMP and MEAN. As for MEAN, this is a really good technology for developing different projects. For this you have to learn JavaScript by heart, as all 4 technologies are based on JS. Besides, full stack becomes seamless and feels unified with MEAN, and using it leads to performance gains and reduction in development time and subsequently, development costs. Moreover, MEAN stack developer salary (https://mobilunity.com/blog/average-full-stack-javascript-developer-salary/) is also pretty high with the knowledge of MEAN, so it will be beneficial to learn MEAN stack.
If your motivation is to find a new job and you are new or feel that your skills are stagnated, then you have to choose where you want to work, for any Startup I will say NodeJS or RubyOnRails will get you in the door, Python or PHP will not hurt and C# or Java will help, if you are interested in the Enterprise, then C# or Java (I have found more Java in the Financial world but not a rule) and having knowledge of NodeJS, RubyOnRails or Python will help you, if your interest moves towards the World of Marketing and Publicity then most of the Agencies are using PHP, RubyOnRails or C#. No matter what I really recommend learn SQL.
You say "backend" which means that you likely are talking about the context of web development. The ecosystem is still young there, as web frameworks are still developing and one of the ORMs is just starting to gain traction (Diesel). However, I strongly feel that its type system and pragmatic approach will lead to it becoming a major force in web development in the coming years. I would expect to see it making waves towards the end of this year as some new web frameworks start to appear.
Two: PHP and Nodejs. Node is javascript and as a backend developer you either know js or need someone who knows it. So once you know js, node just adds backend stuff to a language you already master. Node is really up and coming. E.g. the new facebook bot api for messenger is documented with node examples, not yet with PHP. I found that very significant.
Learn 2-3 modern languages that implement several paradigms. Learn JavaScript to be awed by the power of a few simple concepts, and php to be baffled by it's insane and seemingly everlasting popularity. Look into Java to see what static typing can do for you. Look into Ruby to learn how a good language can be devastated by a cargo-cult community. (Naaaaaah I'm not biased. Not at all.) Find out whether you'd rather use python, or perl, or php, or node.js as your go-to scripting language. And most importantly, check out one or two of the more obscure, not-so-trendy languages... possibly even one of the old monsters, C and C++, and maybe something purely functional like Haskell.
I spend most of my time working with Php, but increasingly it is a matter of what is already in use and known rather than best performance.
Or. Do you want to be the cool kid on the block ? Well, without the risk of getting trouble with the police ... Then you should do something, which is crazy cool but would help you also in the case, you decide to be one of the good guys in the future.
If you are confident and know the basics of some of these languages, picking up new ones will not take much time. The learning curve will be very small. So check which language, the company you want to work for uses and then learn that language if you want to impress them with language knowledge.
Any coder can benefit from learning some flavor of C, probably C++ if you're working with the web. C++ has the advantage of being very strong for building android apps as well and a lot of what we're doing on the web in 2016 ties into mobile. There's a reason the phrase "mobile first" is such a catch phrase. C++, Objective C and C# are all good in this way but I would lean towards C++. Additionally learning any flavor of C teaches you a lot about perl, java and javascript as quite a bit of the syntax overlaps.
Good for backend, good for datascience and most importantly, its very flexible and versatile. I can do so many things with it, even make android games. I don't know java yet I was coding games and android apps. The scripting is a life saver at times too and there are so many frameworks/modules in different fields which makes Python extremely versatile. The syntax is very close to English and even non programmers can understand whats going on when they look at the code (sometimes). Python has the django framework also for web apps.
Definitely not JavaScript (https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/the-lie-that-has-beguiled-a-generation-of-developers-1b33e82de94f). The event loop/async model used in Node.js is a stupid way to do concurrency. It's only for those who don't appreciate real concurrency as it's done in Go, Erlang/Elixir, Clojure, etc. Node has genuine limitations (https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/the-fall-of-the-house-of-node-43697fd56a6).
And recently Automattic bought WooCommerce (and its company), and they are entering ecommerce space to liberate ecommerce. At this point one would need to note that they entered publishing with the intent of liberating publishing, and you know what happened.
In addition to it, you will come across various frameworks, libraries and extensions like Bootstrap, Angular, jQuery, Sass, LESS etc.
In short, these are the main differences between front-end development and back-end development. Thus, they play a crucial role and work hand in hand when designing a website. Alternatively, if you are looking to hire front-end web development services, you can follow this link and connect to a reliable, affordable and fast web development partner.
The front end refers to the client side and sometimes assumed as web design. The backend of the web development is often called as server side. The client side contains the whole thing that the user gets including designs and some languages like HTML and CSS. A front end developer can generate a site without a backend developer. The frontend and backend development are two different things with different utility.
Frontend development is the part that users see and interact with. That includes the UI, the animations, and usually a bunch of logic to talk to the backend. In the modern day that can mean an app running on your iPhone or the HTML and Javascript in a web browser.
For literally anything else, it's not so much a matter that Java is faster than Node.JS, but that it's POSSIBLE in java (often times easy), and it's not possible or incredibly complicated in Node.JS because it doesn‚Äôt fit into the event loop. One of the reasons you see so many javascript junkies so thrilled by the event loop is because their originally front end developers, and the event loop is the only thing that matters in the front end.
Since you have stated that all infrastructure is identical, what you‚Äôre looking for is a raw comparison of calculation ability. According to Node.js vs Java (64-bit Ubuntu quad core) (https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/javascript.html), Java will perform significantly better on computational tasks, while Node.js performs somewhat better with pre-rendering tasks.
Web apps usually take incoming requests, perform some logic interlaced with some outgoing calls and then send a response back. In node, all of this is async by default. You basically have a single thread running an event loop. The event loop has its own incoming request queue, another queue to handle responses from IO calls, etc. Whenever the event loop is not busy executing app logic, it is busy servicing these queues. A lot like JVMs NIO.
Node.js arrived just in time to handle the evolution in websites toward intense multi-connectivity with not only users but other websites. Node.js works unbelievably well with front-end browser frameworks to deliver a clean and fast user experience, and it also facilitates connectivity with other web services via open APIs. Java is used in similar applications but Java was developed for other reasons, mostly involving portability using virtual machines (JVMs). Both technologies use multiple threads, but Node.js uses threads behind the scenes at the C++ layer so the programmer doesn‚Äôt need to worry about synchronous issues.
Node.js is a single threaded asynchronous way of handling requests. It is relatively less resource hungry. Scales up very well. Relies heavily on callbacks - programming is a bit tricky and you need to get used to the style. But in general a complete new way of developing web apps - it's very much like developing client server style apps.
Node.js is lightweight due to its event-based architecture. It is built to work as a web server and copes very well with servicing lightweight tasks. For example, a simple query like calculating, or writing to a database happens very quickly. And if there are a lot of requests and we want to scale the system into a node, you can use the Nginx or Apache webserver. You can have many identical node instances. Then everything will be distributed through load balancing on round-robin. If we run 8 node instances on 16 cores respectively, the OS itself will distribute the instances between the cores. Node does not control this, it will have one thread.
Performance of Node.js is quite predictable but performance of Java application depends on expertise of developer. The typical textbook implementation of web backend in Java will probably be 5‚Äì20 times less performant. However, with proper programming techniques and optimization Java application can run at-par or even faster than Node.js app. The thing is that level of expertise required to write performant Java applications is much higher than the same for Node.js and it is not really an option for many common uses.
NodeJS has been one of the most interesting developments in the world of backend. It is a runtime environment for JavaScript code, with special features that have made it a preferred choice for numerous organizations today. Node is known well for its asynchronous capabilities of handling multiple requests with fluency and efficiency.
Full-stack really is referring to the 'stack' everything from low-level programing, system- administration, and much more, to that higher level, front-end, web-development, stuff. There is a lot more in-between, but the ideas is that if you are a full-stack developer, you have the ability to work anywhere in the stack. Lets say you are working on a front-end (a user directly interacts with the final product, i.e., a website, or app) project, and you find a bug. After some debugging, you realize the bug is not actually in your code, but in the langue in-which you are using to write your code. You could theraticlaly not just fix a bug in your code, but a bug in the langue. This means, that full-stack developers have to think creatively and out of the box. They can not just rely on knowing one specific aspect, or framework, but can work fluidly between multiple. A well trained full-stack developer has a really solid foundation in programing fundamentals, and can easily learn new languages, technologies, or frameworks. I do want to clarify, that a full-stack developer can specialize in one specific area, but knowing just one area of a technology is not good enough for a full-stack developer. There is always more to learn, and we will never be able to learn IT ALL, but it is important to how how each stack interacts with either, so when you are working on developing a new framework, or mobile application, you have an idea of what bugs could show up that could jeopardize security, or something like that.
He has fair knowledge of Networking, Database, User Interface , API, Security etc.
He need not be well versed with all technologies used in front-end and back-end, which is near to impossible. Clearly this takes years of experience.
Front-end technologies manage the user-facing components of the software application. Being a full stack developer, an individual should understand how the software or an app should look, communicate and operate with the user.
And a crazy propensity for detail with skills in database technologies like MySQL, NoSQL, Hadoop.
Now, a Full Stack Programmer is a software development professional who‚Äôs equally proficient in frontend development and backend development. Full Stack Programmers are familiar with each layer of stacks that go into the making of a digital product. They know how each layer functions and, most importantly, can manipulate all the backend components.
Server, Network, and Hosting Environment.This involves understanding what can break and why, taking no resource for granted.Appropriate use of the file system, cloud storage, network resources, and an understanding of data redundancy and availability is necessary.How does the application scale given the hardware constraints?What about multi-threading and race conditions? Guess what, you won‚Äôt see those on your development machine, but they can and do happen in the real world.Full stack developers can work side by side with DevOps. The system should provide useful error messages and logging capabilities. DevOps will see the messages before you will, so make them count.
User Interface-Full stack developers: a) understand how to create a readable layout, or b) acknowledge they need help from artists and graphic designers. Either way, implementing a good visual design is key.Can include mastery of HTML5 / CSS.JavaScript is the up and coming language of the future and lots of exciting work is being done in the JavaScript world (node, backbone, knockout‚Ä¶)
Back in the 2000s, there wasn't much division between frontend and backend. People who built websites were web developers: it‚Äôs the same as the full-stack developer. However in the 2010s, since API First and Single page apps have become popular, the web development community split into two camps. The first group worked with databases, servers, REST or SOAP APIs, and the other with visual stuff. Meanwhile, the Agile software development methodologies remain widespread. One of the Agile practices is a cross-functional team, which means any team member can do any part of the work, whether it's design, analytics, testing, or integration.
Deeper business logic development; in many systems in the late 90s and early 2000s there was a whole separate tier, in between the web server tier and the database tier, to handle less UI oriented, more business logic oriented stuff. These days that tier is more likely to run in the same server environment as the UI generation code in most applications.
"Stack" came out of the trade rags as big players like Sun, IBM and Oracle started selling suites of products aimed at the enterprise application market (mostly java oriented, although the initial versions of some of those suites were thin java wrappers around existing C applications, like IBM's DB2, MQSeries, etc). Eventually people started referring to the "LAMP stack".
If you are building a team, it‚Äôs common to Hire Full Stack Developers. If you are a start-ups and can only afford one developer on the project, the chances are you will need one. Data EximIT has full-stack developers that has the knowledge and proficiency of PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, and converting Photoshop designs to frontend code.
You can gain expertise in technologies at either end of the infrastructure or become a core Full-Stack Software Developer. You can get called Software Developer, Backend Server Specialist Developer or Frontend Programmer depending on the range of technologies you can hustle between. In other words, if you want to function full-stack then do a full stack course at an institute like Imarticus Learning to help with the process of being practically able to use the entire stack of technologies and switch between them as an expert would.
A full-stack web developer is someone who has honed skills in both front-end web design/development and back-end/server coding. You can count on a full-stack web developer to design, code, implement and maintain a fully functional modern interactive website on his/her own (not just a static website with a few pages).
It's just more bull-crap jargon that the industry doesn't need. A stack is the technology stack you develop on. Linux Apache MySql Php, or C# .NET IIS SqlServer, etc. So we were already "full stack" developers since we touched every one of those components in the stack. Hopefully it will go away soon.
In this case "stack" means the technology stack. The term "full-stack programmer" is, then, actually misleading in my opinion because there are two stacks involved, a client stack and a server stack. I see no sense in which the client sits on top of the server in that either can be swapped out for other technology without affecting the other as long as HTTP isn't swapped out which in modern times is a given.
A fullstack developer can take up a single handed prototyping and production worthy release of tech stack for a web app. From defining database, server components, deployment and all that is needed on the client side. A full stack developer of that skill is really rare and is would be a costly one to get to work for you. They can be excellent co-founders though for a business guy.
A full stack programmer is someone who thoroughly understands the designing and implementation of any application and knows how to build a fully functional application from scratch using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and Java. He/she can work well with all three layers of the application
What‚Äôs expected of a ‚Äúfull stack‚Äù developer is far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. They need to understand how to scale an app to handle millions of hits a day (or hour?), what ‚Äúpets vs. cattle‚Äù means and why it‚Äôs important, the reason they should choose MongoDB over MySQL (or vice versa), the CAP theorem, PaaS‚Äôs, IaaS‚Äôs, a dozen configuration management tools, whether it makes sense to built an app in Rails, Django, Wordpress, Swift or a combination based on the requirements, micro services versus monolithic apps, and two dozen other things.
If we go into more details then we can find things such as Full Stack Web Developer and MEAN developer ,which basically is specialisation of the above definition. So full stack web developers are expected to know common web development technologies and frameworks such HTML5,CSS/CSS3,JavaScript and so on.
Is there a language available or under development that is C ‚Äúflavored‚Äù (syntax similar to PHP, C# or Javascipt) that consolidates both the server and client side of web applications for commercial web development? We all saw the definition of full ‚Äústack programmers‚Äù on Quora, et al. What about a ‚Äúfull stack language‚Äù that really works?
In fantasy land the rock stars are full stack developers who can span the entire spectrum from OS to CSS. In the real world, developers have different strengths and interests. In some cases, "full stack" means mediocre skills in a lot of areas
Full stack developer is a person who has enough knowledge and experience in both frontend and backend development. There is a bunch of technologies full stack developers us, such as LAMP, Ruby on Rails, LAPP, MAMP, MEAN and many more. For example, MEAN is a great stack to build a web application. It has the technology for server side (Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB) and client side (AngularJS). Full stack developers are very demanded everywhere nowadays, especially in major IT companies. What‚Äôs more, full stack developer salary
LibreOffice Writer can import word docs and Word can import open office docs. But the round-trip does some damage to the document. I don‚Äôt know whose fault it is, but interoperability is only so-so. One reason I might have to buy Word is to be compatible with office-mates using Word. Sigh.
LibreOffice and Microsoft office have been mainstays in the Office application, with the main difference being that LibreOffice is open source. For at least a decade, Microsoft has trying to meet the market of consumers and enterprise, and the result has been a product that fits in the middle, not exactly optimized for both. Most consumers are looking for an office suite that uses mobile apps and relies on the cloud for saving, collaboration, and security, and accomplishes their major tasks throughout the day, while also keeping costs down. For example, Creativity 365suite, which is compatible with iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows. It is focused on creative professionals, and has a leading 1 TB of file storage, combines several creativity apps into the suite, including a PDF reader, video editor, animator app, note taker, markup app, and pocket scanner app. Disclaimer: I am a member of the Kdan team. This suite allows creative professionals to quickly get up to speed, especially in a team, where the leading collaboration features will easily allow you to share your creations with your team, wherever they might be.
I have been a university professor and held vice president-level positions in two universities, I have held management-level jobs in three startup fintech companies, and I run my own business. I have used Libreoffice exclusively since 2001 when it was still Star Office and then Open Office. I have written books, numerous scientific research papers, and given hundreds of conference and public presentations with it, and used it to make the content for numerous educational videos. I have written over 200 business documents, and created hundreds of flier type documents using Draw. I use the three main tools on a daily basis, and I have not found ANYTHING that I have been unable to do with Libreoffice. If someone complains about file compatibility, I tell them to pretend they are computer literate and download Libreoffice.
Unfortunately LibreOffice and similar OpenOffice forks do not have two features of MS Word that I cannot live without. First, I cannot create keyboard shortcuts that I use during nearly every minute of my typing in a word processor. For example I use command-option j to move my cursor back one word and command-option k and command-option l to move my cursor left and right respectively. I have many such keyboard shortcuts that allow me to type far faster in MS Word than I can in the OpenOffice software (and in most other text edit
LibreOffice implements a reasonably well-thought-out open document format which is now an ISO standard. Microsoft belatedly supported this standard, so you can now save as ods or odt from Office, and import such files if somebody e-mails then to you. This is not out of the goodness of their hearts, it is because governments forced their hand.
Most of the answers here so far snipe at Microsoft for continuing to charge for versions of it's full featured Office suite. That suite offers significantly more features and associated programs. I recently counted 29 programs included in or associated with the top line Office 365 subscription product. So there's far more there than you'll find in Libre Office, Open Office, or the Google Office Suite.
However if your ‚Äúreplace‚Äù means to do what you're doing everyday, like generating/editing documents, spreadsheets and slides, writing thesis which includes math formulas, drawing diagrams, ‚Ä¶etc., then LibreOffice together with Open Document Format can definitely do everything you need, plus good interoperability for your files.
Possibly. However good is relevant to what you what to do with it. Microsoft's strength is that it is industry standard, you can walk into any company in the world and chances are they will be running a version of Microsoft Office. There is very little difference between versions (apart from between 2003 and 2007, when the ribbon was introduced) so there isn't much of a learning curve and whatever shortcuts you know will work across versions (speaking from experience with Excel).
For me, MS office has features that I use a lot and are absent from LO. And documents created in LO, saved in .doc or .docx formats, often cause me trouble when I open them in MS Word.
Microsoft Corporation does have a compete capability, staff, sellers, resellers, and marketers who keep their products visible, preinstalled on machines, and discussed in the trade press and the blogosphere.
My Word docs use sophisticated formatting and Libre Office cannot do the same formatting without being glitchy and difficult to format in the way I format them on MS Word... And if I open a complex-formatted Libre Office doc the formatting is changed or corrupted from the day before. Odd.
And of course, the answer to that question is unfortunately, No. Even the simplest things like formatting a Word document get hosed when bouncing back and forth. And forget about getting LibreOffice Spreadsheet to make a direct connection to your office database. Security will usually block such activity, even if the connection is technically possible.
No, it simply doesn‚Äôt have all the features of MS Office but it doesn‚Äôt have to because it is free. For most people LibreOffice does everything that you need. You don‚Äôt need to have MS Office unless your job or business requires it. Personally, I use LibreOffice for stuff I want to save to my computer and Google Docs for things online. If I was doing professional writing I would invest in MS. Word or their subscription.
Why would I need M$ Office? Because M$ Office is not LibreOffce and LibreOffice is not M$ Office. This means, M$ Office will have something LibreOffice don‚Äôt have and LibreOffice will have something M$ Office don‚Äôt have. And this means compatibility issues. If you open word file made with M$ Office in LibreOffice or vice versa and file is not trivial document it will be a mess. Here are no need to talk about M$ Office and LibreOffice, even if you make word file with M$ Office 2010 or 2007 and try to open it with M$ Office 2019 it will be a mess too. So, how can different application makers make different applications without compatibility issues, when same maker can‚Äôt make different versions of same application 100% compatib
I like the amount of options offered by Microsoft and I‚Äôve been using it for ages, especially Word and PowerPoint, and I would call the office package practical and functional. I used to have some serious problems with large documents in Word a decade ago - many files were lost during saving, but later on, Microsoft managed to fix this problem and since then Office has been a great ally. But, when I am on the go, I use Creativity 365 and Document 365 Business by Kdan Mobile. The apps in both suites have easy-to-use yet comprehensive interfaces and mobile-optimized features. Creativity 365 includes: Animation Desk, Write-on Video, NoteLedge, Markup, and Pocket Scanner. These apps allow me to create professional-looking animations, videos and presentations that I can deliver straight from my mobile devices; and Document 365 Business lets me edit, annotate and share my PDFs with no hassle involved. I use both of these for work and leisure and recommend them as mobile productivity solutions.
It doesn't even have support for Open Document. Microsoft says that it supports but in reality that's a lie. Have you ever tried to open any of the ODF formats in MS Office? And have you ever tried to open a MS Office file in LibreOffice? LibreOffice can handle most of the MS Office files while MS Office can't handle anything but its own.
Did you ever stop to think how many hours of work that suite took? It has been brainstormed for more than a decade to get to where it is today , and believe me, it wasn't built by one ‚Äúgood programmer‚Äù, but by a team of excellent experts in the software industry, who have big salaries and motivation, and they probably couldn‚Äôt even build 10% of the product in only one weekend if for any reason they have to.
Not a very good one, because you're confusing a rough prototype with a completed product. I can throw together a basic UI and backend for a web app that provides a CRUD interface to edit a text document in a few hours (and have done so numerous times for different projects), but adding all the advanced features and dealing with all the gotchas and corner cases that take it from "basically works" to "is competitive with mainstream document editors" is a years-long job on the inside. Similarly, CRUD table editing is easy, but providing a robust language for doing actual spreadsheet calculations beyond simple stuff like summing columns, especially when dealing with arbitrary inputs, is a very, very big project. I seriously doubt anybody could create a robust presentation application given several years of full-time work, let alone a few hours.
You would be so phenomenal as to be incredible (that is un-believable) and not in the "good" sense. The most I've ever known a person to code in a weekend is about 5k lines and that might have been actually a 4 day weekend and some of that code might have been auto-generated. Now, it did implement a complete sub-system that we wanted written, but it wasn't three independent programs. nor even as complex as one of those programs.
You might be a decent programmer, although I think we would need to see the final result to judge that. That said, your ability to judge market demand might need to be honed a bit. Who is demanding a Python-based Excel rewrite?
Tests include unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests, load tests, perf tests, security checks, a variety of functional tests, ui tests and many more. These are performed by devs themselves, testers, vendor testers around the world, beta testers all along the way, and racks and racks and racks of systems with VMs which test the product on many different OS/product combinations. I've only scratched the surface.
As I remember, the original Star Office, the ancestor of all the Java-based OpenOffice code, was written by six people in about a year. Considerable work has been added since then. The original Word core team was about 100 people, and the achievement was much smaller in terms of features. It‚Äôs far easier to clone software than to think it up from scratch, and easier to write in an OO language than to write in C and assembler.
A good programmer is someone who knows how to solve problems, which includes knowing how to go about solving the problem of "I don't yet know how to solve this problem". And that's it, really...
Let me put it this way. Say you could. Which, in my opinion, would imply there are more people out there that could do this. Which would pretty much mean career death for many of the software engineers out there, including myself. The fact that building quality software is incredibly involved and time-consuming is at the foundation of the job security we, software engineers, enjoy so much.
Apple sells hardware. The sell iPhones and iPads and MacBooks and a variety of other hardware. They also distribute software that you can only legally run on that hardware. Legally, I can‚Äôt take Mac OS X and install it on my Dell Precision Tower here under my desk. You are only licensed to install Apple software on Apple hardware. Apple does not independently sell software because that software is designed only to run on the hardware you already bought. Therefore, the cost of Apple‚Äôs software is bundled into the hardware you already purchased. You didn‚Äôt get Apple software for free. You paid for it when you bought Apple hardware.
Microsoft is traditionally a Windows-and-Office company. Sure, things are changing: they forayed into hardware with various degrees of success (XBox, Zune, Nokia), into search services (Bing), and they are now expanding seriously into business-to-business cloud services. They are active even in consumer cloud services (OneDrive, outlook.com), but I suspect that they are cost centers and used to attract customers into the business-to-business side of the same services.
In the case of Open Office / Libre Office, it's an esoterical belief in the freedom of software. If you're happy with the drastic decrease of quality and functionality, use that. But really, it's as far from equivalent as 1990 is from 2015.
I will first point out that Microsoft Office is not an equivalent product to Apple‚Äôs iWork suite. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote have similar basic functionality but Microsoft Office is the industry standard (even Apple uses Microsoft Office internally) for productivity software and any serious professional needs to have access to it. If you look at any of Apple‚Äôs marketing material, they talk about Macs running Office, not their bundled free productivity software. Beyond just Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Office includes several other programs like Access, Publisher, Skype for Business, etc. Even if you ignore the differences in functionality, Office is a very big part of Microsoft‚Äôs business and asking them to give Office away for free is like asking Apple to give iPhones away for free or McDonald‚Äôs to give Big Macs away for free.
Inertia. Microsoft was founded and flourished in the days when software was a product that you bought, installed on your own computer via a physical medium. You bought and sold software like you bought and sold books or music - the medium was indeed the message. The phenomenal success of Windows and MS Office was based on that model, and they‚Äôre not going to change it as long as people are prepared to pay. And people are prepared to pay largely because of inertia again. If your company has been using MS Office for years, there‚Äôs going to be a lot of resistance to switching to LibreOffice, Google Docs or whatever shiny new office suite comes out in the next few years. MS Office doesn‚Äôt need to be better than its competitors; it just needs to have a few unique features that some people find indispensable. Let‚Äôs say you want your company to switch to LibreOffice because it can handle 99% of the tasks your employees do as well as or better than MS Office. But if the head of accounting says some unique Excel feature is absolutely vital and the accounts department will grind to a halt without it, you‚Äôll keep using MS Office, because having different departments using different office software is a headache.
Open Office and various variants are free, though. These are open-source projects and managed by a wide community of developers, for consumers. But Open Office is part of the Apache tools and the Apache foundation is getting revenue by providing paid support to customers while developers are actually writing their code for free. The Apache Organisation is set up as a charitable organisation and thus doesn‚Äôt have to pay much in taxes. They‚Äôre also set as a non-profit organisation so that basically keeps costs even lower. But they do have employees and managers who will get paid for their work, and they earn quite a bit from support, sponsors and donations.
I'd reckon Apple gives their version of Office away for free because their hardware is much more expensive (this is just a straight up fact. I'm not arguing that they're worse or better. That's a personal preference and UX thing). You have used MacBooks that are as cheap as $700, but some newer configurations go for $2100. I've heard of techies compare who were on one platform and were looking into switching into the other do research... $4,000 for a Mac desktop which includes hardware and peripherals like a monitor and input devices, vs. a Windows desktop with the specs to handle the most demanding tasks for $2,500. The latter also included having to rebuy all the commercial software equivalents for Windows. Given all other variables being equal, you can buy a Windows machines + license for M$ Office, and it'd still be cheaper than a OSX machine.
Microsoft make their money off software. You could argue Office should be included with Windows, but not everyone wants to pay for Office and it would make Windows much more expensive if they rolled the costs into one. Additionally no one wants to pay a subscription to use the OS on their computer, whereas people will pay for other software subscriptions.
In fact, MS could even have a financial incentive to make the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù Office completely free of charge: the idea is that by making it free it would quickly discard every other competing product. At that point, it becomes a no-brainier for heavy users to subscribe to 360 in order to enjoy the online benefits, such as a faster update cycle etc.
It is because, Microsoft is charging for the service they are offering with the product... and not for the product itself...!! Also they have lot of features which many other utilities dont have... so need better features then pay to get the best...!!
MS Office is one of Microsoft‚Äôs headline products, which generates significant amount of revenue. So Microsoft is not going to give it for free, however you may use a free trial for some time, or, in some cases, limited preinstalled versions (which are likely also not free, because PC/laptop manufacturer likely alredy paid for them, and you paid when you buy your PC/laptop).
Now think about this same rationale for Microsoft Office. There are costs involving the development, over a thousand highly skilled people working on that suite. Can you imagine Microsoft making the same business decision as GM? Yes! Maybe Microsoft donates a volume licence to a medical organisation they like. Microsoft is now seen as a sponsor, plus the actual help: the software is good. Now, a refugee‚Äôs-aid organisation asks for the same thing. Microsoft concedes the licence. Afterwards, end-users spread the word: ‚ÄúMicrosoft is temporarily giving away free Microsoft Office licences!‚Äù It‚Äôs a plummet in the revenue. At last, remove the word ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù from the last sentence. The well is dry. Those developers don‚Äôt have anymore water to drink. They die, taking their creative brains to the grave. The software is dead.
Microsoft could include a copy of office with windows- one reason they don‚Äôt may be they don‚Äôt want a repeat of the anti-trust case which was kicked off in no small part by MS including MSIE with windows 98. Even with out this threat- the fact MS dominates both the desktop operating system market and the productivity suite market with MS office- they don‚Äôt have a reason to change their model.
I presume it is because it is bad software. (I was forced to use it in the younger past, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have used it. I use a plaintext editor or/and LaTeX for any text I write.) Good software (such as Linux and LaTeX) is usually free. Heck, why the hell does anyone spend a single dime on Micro$oft Office if you can get the WYSIWYG Packet LibreOffice for free?
Microsoft is primarily a software company. They are trying hard to force their online stuff on you and selling it on a different basis (ongoing subscription) but it is still a software company. Windows 10 was free for most though.
Apple doesn‚Äôt have an equivalent software. Microsoft Office is by far the best Office Suite out there. I am sure that you will be able to find PC vendors that include Office for free or close to it with the purchase of a new computer. That is exactly how you pay for Apple software such as Pages, Numbers or Keynote. You pay for it by buying their premium priced hardware.
I‚Äôm not sure but there was a cheaper Microsoft Office equivalent called ‚ÄòMicrosoft Works‚Äô but it was discontinued a few years ago. It was automatically installed on most Windows PC's back in the day. If you‚Äôre lucky like I was and brought a laptop or desktop that came with the Works CD, it can be installed on Windows 10.
Apple offers soft wear free only because they can make up for it in the price of hard wear. Microsoft charges less, but charges for everything separately. Basically, when you pay for an Apple product you are also paying for updates upfront rather than later. Which is the better value depends on what you are doing. My 5 year old Dell is having lots of problems. My brother‚Äôs 10 year old Mac is running fine. They cost about the same amount because I opted for a bigger screen and the convenience of having Microsoft (not because I think it is superior but because it is comparable with the computers of those around me I am most likely to share files with.) Microsoft is leagues beyond Apple if you're a programmer. That said, Apple products are more intuitive and tend to last longer.
So on the Apple thing: Apple bundles a bunch of software with their Mac PCs, including MacOS, which is designed to convince you to pay about twice as much money for the same basic hardware -- maybe a nicer case -- than if you bought an HP or Dell or ASUS. Apple makes about a 40% margin on their PC hardware, versus about 5% for a mainstream company like HP and as low as 3% for a low-end PC maker like Acer.
I would like to differ somewhat on the previous answers. What they have mentioned is just the meaning of Mean Stack. They correctly explained meaning of full stack. But here the reference of Full is Java DevOps Full Stack.
Full stack developer is some one who is able to work on all the layers of the application such as front end,server logic and database.
MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express, AngluarJS,Node.JS.If you want to build a system, where you need a backend with database, an easy to learn language for middleware (Node.js), where you can use JavaScript an Angular for your website, then this all can be done by a MEAN stack developer.
However, saying that you're a MEAN stack developer means you specialize in FULL stack implementation using only the above language and technologies.
A MEAN stack developer is someone who has knowledge in some particular areas alone. MEAN stack development refers to the development process that falls within these particular set of technologies MongoDB, Expressjs, AngularJs, Node.js
MEAN stands for Mongodb which is NoSQL database, Express.js is a Node based server framework , AngularJS is a opensource frontend javasript framework and Nodejs is web framework for I/O based web application . These are a group of technologies based on JavaScript (Mongodb is written in JS and also has REPL command line interface).
MEAN stack is basically a collection of JavaScript-based web development technologies that includes MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular and Nodejs based applications.Using MEAN we can build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.
Full stack means the combination of technologies that you use to create a web app. This includes the database and the front end and backend languages and frameworks. There are many stacks, because you can use many different languages, databases and frameworks to do the same thing. MEAN is just one of many stacks. You hear about it a lot because it‚Äôs very popular. But there are many others, and developers all have their favorites.
who deveop the application as using (ex:java or .net as backend angular as backend and mysql as db) at the sametime all mean stack developers are full stack developers.
even with The MEAN stack you will still need a few things usually Bootstrap or Material design for your UI and other API or libraries dependent on your project. You can use Node to install into your app.
For Full-stack Developer is someone having experience and skills to develop the back-end , the front-end the database design , and system design is the rock star , with any technology , he can develop the project
Full-stack refers to a group of programming languages and tools a developer learns to handle both the front-end and back-end development of a website. MEAN stack, on the other hand, is a popular full-stack framework, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and NodeJS.
Hackathons are lonnnnnnnng. It is where computer programmers come together to pitch ideas. At hackathon events, people generally team up and then work closely together in these small groups behind their laptop in order to turn the ideas they have in their head into apps.
Does it matter that much? I have done a few Hackathons in my times and what wins at the end is the industry experience you bring to the table on that day. With so much readily available pieces of code available on the internet, what matters is the Proof Of Concept (POC) created / assembled and the ability to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the idea. That's my opinion about this matter
They have a way of tracking the dates of either your databases creations and they will surely know that the project was created by the way you present the project will just tell them because the project that you did earlier you will be very comfortable presenting while a freshly created one you will have some bit of struggles presenting!
This will vary from hackathon to hackathon. For a formally organised one there will be written rules or guidelines, and yes this will generally involve the specification of a team size. Working on one‚Äôs own is very much against the spirit of what a hackathon is - collaboration provides an outcome which is more than the sum of its parts. If you try to work on your own: you won‚Äôt be send to jail; you may not be stopped; but your entry in a competitive sense would not be allowed.
Ironhack‚Äôs bootcamps specialize in web development and iOS mobile development. The courses last for a duration of eight weeks, Monday through Friday typically from 9am until 8pm. During the morning there are short lectures followed by exercises and the afternoons are dedicated to projects. Ironhack‚Äôs Madrid bootcamp is taught mostly in Spanish, while the Barcelona courses are conducted in English. Classes are capped at 15-20 students in order to maintain at least 6 students per teacher ratio.
Programming was never a strange thing to me. I attended Engineering School, where I learned some C and Assembly. Working on financial markets for the last 11 years got me some VBA skills.
The Bootcamp sets you up with foundational knowledge required to learn a programming language and then equips you with an array of tools that you can choose to hone after the Bootcamp. Their exceptional curriculum, having stood the test of time, takes you from understanding things like 'What is the internet?' all the way to designing two prototypes from scratch; thereby giving you a comprehensive understanding of what it actually means to 'code'.
Being in the automotive industry for the past 3 years and half, I wasn‚Äôt quite satisfied with the direction of my career. I decided to take a chance and I quit my job. The next few months, I experimented different things: digital marketing, setting up an e-commerce, sales for a small company, but I still felt that none of these were right for me. I remembered that I used to program a bit when I was younger, and that I enjoyed it. As I was getting more work through my digital marketing service company, I wanted to offer more to my clients. I thought it would be interesting to give it a try again. I began doing online course, but very soon I hit a wall. I could not get myself to complete any of them and wasn‚Äôt making any progress. Something had to change.
The course is tough... it really is a bootcamp. That being said there were students of all levels, some who had HTML/CSS experience and others who had never worked on any aspect of an app before. By the time the project came along we all had skills needed to create the idea we wanted. My team made an activity booking app, I was honestly surprised by how much we were able to build in such a short time.
My work experiences always turned around business development and marketing. Over the years I was more and more interested in the digital. My curiosity urged to me to learn a little the front end: HTML and CSS. I decided to be a freelancer as digital consultant at the beginning of 2017. I accompany startups and small and medium company in their digital strategy and the design of small website with Wordpress.
My experience at Le Wagon Brasil was unbelievable, probably the best decision of my career! As an entrepreneur, I‚Äôm confident I reached the level of autonomy that I was so desperately missing in my previous ventures to launch my next digital businesses faster or tackle new professional challenges as a product manager with the right skillset. I used to think programming was boring and something for nerds only, but the methodology of Le Wagon made me completely change my mind. I learned fast, very concrete stuff and it was even fun. I‚Äôm now one of the biggest fan of Le Wagon‚Äôs teaching platform.
Learning such skills in so little time shows how well the curriculum and teachers are prepared. During 9 weeks, you work with a different buddy every day until you have finished the core course. You begin with ruby, before moving into SQL, front end and Rails. Once the core curriculum is over, you team up by groups of 4 to deliver your final project. This method is super effective because collaboration is at the center of the learning experience, you have to adapt to different thinking patterns and profiles to succeed and learn. Plus, it is an incredible community, fun, caring and able to help you debug anything even once you‚Äôre no longer a student!
A database management system is designed to coordinate multiple users accessing the same data at the same time. A file-processing system is usually designed to allow one or more programs to access different data files at the same time. In a file-processing system, a file can be accessed by two programs concurrently only if both programs have read-only access to the file.
One of the things that is pretty easy to forget is that computers are, in the end, machines. Whereas we have the ability to perceive the world around us, and have complex mechanisms that allow us to make value judgments, communicate with others, and apply logic to solve problems, computers operate through complex electrical circuits that ultimately operate on switches that are either on or off. Modern computers have millions of these little switches called transistors. Unlike the early days when computers were far simpler, programmers could effectively use punch cards to write simple programs, today‚Äôs computers are so complex, and so widespread, that people have developed abstractions to make working with computers more like the way we work in the real world. In addition, as technology progresses, gradually the way we did things previously become obsolete, so we need to develop better ways of doing things.
There are also differences in the expected level of service provided by file systems and databases. While databases must be self consistent at any instant in time (think about banks tracking money!), provide isolated transactions and durable writes, a file system provides much looser guarantees about consistency, isolation and durability. The database uses sophisticated algorithms and protocols to implement reliable storage on top of potentially unreliable file systems. It is these algorithms that make database storage more expensive in terms of processing and storage costs that make general file systems an attractive option for data that does not require the extra guarantees provided by a database.
A file-based system is a collection of data stored in an orderly manner in a file. It is a file packed with data, with no metadata and thus no organizing structure. A database is a self-organizing collection of integrated records, whose metadata gives it structure. The bottom line is that when dealing with a file-based system, your application program must "know" the way the file is ordered and access desired data at a very low level. With a database, the knowledge in the metadata enables the application program to access desired data on a much more abstract level. Programming is much easier.
A file system is a method for storing and organizing computer files. A file management system is a database that accesses to single files or tables at a time. Data is directed stored in a set of file. The file system may use a storage device such as a hard disk or CO-ROM.
A Database in General is nothing but a collection of Data which means contents are present inside a Database. Database now a days are of 3 types one is RDBMS, NOSQL and Graph Database. So Data is available now the comes another question where this Data needs to be stored. It has to be stored somewhere else ryt? There comes the storage part. Normally The datas inside the database are stored in tables under a File systems. Even in this we have NFS ( Network File Systems) , raw devices etc. The storage also needs to be managed and monitored like Databases . So we have Storage Administrators like DBA's. we have Tivoli From IBM and we have EMC storage which are very famous. Now Big Data and Hadoop is gaining popular we have HDFS ( Hadoop Distributed File Systems) used for Storage purpose. Hope I gave a basic idea of DB and Storage.
File Systems specialize in managing unstructured information. Traditionally, a file system has no knowledge of the internal contents of a file. It does have some relationship information, such as a location in a namespace, or timestamps. Some file systems permit storing multiple ‚Äúpieces‚Äù of unstructured information. Some file systems permit storing extended meta-data that belongs to applications, but not the file system.
Meanwhile, a database management system is often completely independent of the OS control systems (though usually can only be used on one specific OS for various reasons), and the description of the contents of the database is but a tiny part of what it can do and what it's used for. The DBMS often includes an elaborate language that allows advanced users to manipulate the database in a programmatic way, and its main purpose is frequently to perform queries, which will range from simple "find every entry in table A where Price is above 200" to extremely complex cross-referenced conditional searches with fifty pages of attached documentation for that one query.
When looking at file oriented storage (fos), your data is stored in independent files, that don‚Äôt communicate with each other. This approach is used in cases, where local computers each have their own storage. Example: If you download a new game onto your computer and register it with the registration key xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (top secret!). This key will be stored locally, most locally in a tiny text file, hidden deep inside the file hierarchy. Your buddy, playing the same game, will not be able to access your registration key on his computer, as it is stored locally on your harddrive. Another example is your local weather station at home, saving the temperatures of the last 24 hours in a JSON and text file. If this station saves the humidity in a separate JSON file, these two files won‚Äôt communicate with each other, and it is very hard to merge or compare the two with each other. That‚Äôs where the database approach comes in.
A database is an organization of data where the data content is organized in a structured way. The structure is intended to provide the ability to define relations (the ‚ÄòRelational‚Äô part of Relational Databases) between the elements of the data structure. A Database Management System (DBMS) is used to control access to the database, and controls the infrastructure that defines the relations within the databases. Databases are typically organized following a hierarchy of databases, schemas, tables, records and fields, and the nature and behavior of each of these tiers in the hierarchy is mostly fixed and well defined.
A file system is what your operating system in your computer has for storing and organizing the data in files and folders. There are many different file systems supported my many different operating systems. You see, the operating system needs some *internal* structure so that will map the raw bits in the hard drive to the fancy hierarchy of files and folders and their contents, as well. As a user you don't need to know anything about these internal workings, as a technical person, it depends on what you are doing, but even the overwhelming majority of technical persons don't need to know the intricate details of the various file systems. It is just an abstraction for managing data at the operating system level.
A database system is also a structure for storing data, but instead tries to store it to minimize subsequent access time. The database itself is responsible for all data placement, down to the block level.
What is remarkable is that this difference does not originate from technology (it is perfectly possible to build a file system with full integrity control: this has been done in the past and some still have similar features) but from usage and habits.
Any structure change to the file would need changes to the file as well as to the application programs accessing those files to process data. That means more change is needed making it rigid. Also, the concurrency, security, metadata management etc., are to be taken care by the programmer.
A file system is a way of organizing data on physical storage such as disks. Database is a way of structuring and representing data. In order to persist that data, a database manager will make use of a file system. There is no database file system, you're crossing concepts.
A database is a collection of data structured, formatted, and stored in some way that‚Äôs determined by some ‚ÄúDBMS‚Äù (database management system) ‚Ä¶ some program or suite of programs which ‚Ä¶ uh ‚Ä¶ manage databases. (This is brought to you by the department for redundancy department).
A DBMS provides backup and recovery option for recovering from hardware and software failure where as file system does not.
Database : It stores data in structured form( i.e. in rows and columns ) . This allows you to access it much faster compared to file system. This data is distributed all over your hard disk . You cannot find it like a file or open the table in some editor. You will need Database Manager to access it. It is a little more difficult to implement however it is a lot more secure compared to file system.
Important advantage of using a DBMS over most file systems is speed and / or flexibility or enforcement of business rules about what is allowed and in how the data is stored and retrieved, but sometimes the file system has the advantage for certain types of data such as in the case of binary (rather than ASCII) data.
A file system is very similar to what you find in the Windows and Apple Operating System with your Folders and Files on the computer. There is some grouping/ordering of certain files and folders usually related to the core of the Operating System, but beyond that, you organize/create files and folders as you like and the File System keeps track of the names of the folders, their locations on the hard drive, and the files contained in the folders, along with general information about each, such as creation dates, modified dates, author, file type, etc. A File System may use a database as part of it's structure in order to keep data/information relating to the various Files and Folders in the File System.
A traditional file system is often called a ‚Äútwo-dimensional flat file‚Äù as what you would find with Excel or any other spreadsheet/datasheet. That is, it is simply comprised of a 2-dimension rows and columns. Just imagine if you had to find/update one of these rows in a flat file of 1 million records? Also flat files are renowned for anomalies such as, redundant information that appears multiple times in the file or update changes to a column which re-appears in many rows. Then are many other problems, concerns that can reduce a flat file to one containing ‚Äúuseless information.‚Äù Enter a DBMS (DataBase Management System). A DBMS is a systematic way of organizing data to avoid all the problems associated with flat files. There are a number of ways of doing this but the most popular way is using a Relational database model (RDBMS). An RDBMS is a methodology of organizing data so as to avoid all anomalies associated with flat files. Also, a properly designed and implemented RDBMS comes with a very easy-to-learn programming language, SQL (Structured Query Language), which provides management of all updates, deletions, insertions to the database. Most everything you can think of in commerce is a database: Amazon, Google, eBay, marketing, analytics, even politics ‚Ä¶ It is all about data and how it is organized and accessed. A daily billion dollar business!
A database however consists of structured data (records or tuples or rows of a table) and in most cases contains relational data (stored in tables with columns and rows and which can reference each other by using primary and foreign keys). A database implements that on the basis of files, but puts a different layer on top of that. So a table might be stored onto several files, and one file might contain rows (multiple rows stored together as blocks or extents) from different tables.
Relational systems add what I think of as a third dimension. The basic structure is an array of data where each row has some unique identifier. Other arrays can then reference the first array by including the unique identifier in each record. Think of the first array as a Parent and the second as a Child. Then recall one Parent can have many Children. While each Child has only one Parent. Well, ok, the analogy isn‚Äôt exact for us mammals, but hopefully you get the idea. It is a one-to-many relationship.
If you‚Äôre looking to make big money MySQL training is worth more than Access on your CV. If you‚Äôve got something in mind you want to make then you almost certainly want to learn Access and go make that thing - and if it‚Äôs for your career switching to MySQL after you know how to develop databases because you‚Äôve made things is probably stronger still.
MySQL is ‚Äòjust‚Äô a database, so in order to allow users to intereact with it you will need to create a front-end, using PHP or some other technology allowing you to create dynamic webpages, or Visual Studio (or similar) to create more traditional client/server applications.
What Access provided, for me, was a ‚Äúquick and easy‚Äù way to learn the basic concepts of how a database works. I‚Äôm taking about data input, reporting, and most importantly, data modeling.
Anyway, yes, I think it would help you if you use MS Access, mostly so you can focus on bigger concepts. Once you get comfortable, you can start looking at the SQL generated and see how it works. Then off to a real database.
First, SQL is a standard that is implemented slightly differently by all database management systems. (Think HTML and how it‚Äôs rendered slightly differently by different browsers.) I know one case where SQL is not correctly rendered by Access, although that was several years ago and may have been fixed by now.
Access is a fabulous tool for helping you learn how to create databases and structure queries. I still haven‚Äôt found a better GUI for visually creating queries (although I haven‚Äôt looked too hard, admittedly). However, unless you make an effort, it isn‚Äôt a great tool for learning SQL. First, the Access query tool abstracts away all the SQL unless you specifically look at it. I developed in Access for years before I really learned SQL or felt confident writing SQL without using Access. Second, the flavor of SQL that Access uses is far from standard. Yes, the basics are the same, but there are enough differences that you can‚Äôt assume that almost any SQL generated by Access would translate directly to any other SQL DB.
MSAccess has got a very efficient GUI to create tables, relationships and then SQL Queries. These tools will help you in the beginning as they will free you the time required to debug a syntactical error and instead focus on the more important stuff e.g. why won‚Äôt an OUTER JOIN produce the results you were expecting.
My advice is to not get too bogged down by the thoery of the DBMS concepts, skim through them, to get the basics, concentrate on SQL concepts more and start practicing Once you get to the advanced level, you can deep dive in to the theory of DBMS concepts.
Access can implement some SQL in it, and can even create SQL like queries, but like most MS office products it tends to mangle things in interesting ways that cause serious confusion when you actually try and hack in to them to see what its doing, Access seems to have a fetish for putting brackets in the code for no apparent reason, if you need a cheap way of learning SQL then get started with SQL server express edition which with the express edition of SSMS even gives you a nice GUI to play with.
The JET database engine (or whatever the latest version uses) that‚Äôs good enough for home users and up to about ten people at a time but can‚Äôt go over 2GB of data and shouldn‚Äôt be used at near that level.
I would avoid Access for the simple fact that the propose of Access databases back the days (when Office started invading windows machines, back in 1990 (26 years ago!)) was a very different propose if today's data handling, nowadays you have geo-spatials fields that treat coordinates and makes all the calculations for example to query how many places in a radius of a location can be found on the database.
Microsoft Excel is the oldest spreadsheet application that is used in almost all companies. Here are a few usages of Excel
Microsoft Excel is a bookkeeping page program. That implies it's utilized to make frameworks of text, numbers and equations indicating estimations. That is very important for some organizations, which use it to record uses and pay, plan financial plans, outline information and briefly present monetary outcomes.
Even a decade back, MS Excel had no real contention when it came to data analysis or financial planning and accounting. However, the corporate world is abuzz now with the idea that the death of MS Excel is near. Yet, 63% of US companies have agreed in a 2018 survey conducted by Robert Half that their internal operations are heavily dependent on MS Excel and Office 2010 still has a worldwide penetration of over 83%. When it comes to handling data or strategy formulation, MS Excel remains the king. And you need to join one of the best free Excel courses to upskill yourself and find success in your career.
The main use for spreadsheets is simple data processing, such as book keeping, accounting, or just general number crunching. They are also often used to exchange, store, import, or export data.
Excel is used widely in any financially-related activity. The ability to create new spreadsheets where users can define custom formulas to calculate anything from a simple quarterly forecast to a full corporate annual report makes Excel highly appealing. Excel is also used widely for common information organization and tracking like a list of sales leads, project status reports, contact lists, and invoicing. Finally, Excel is a useful tool for scientific and statistical analysis with large data sets. Excel's statistical formulas and graphing can help researches perform variance analysis, chi-square testing, and chart complex data.
Integration with other applications - Microsoft Excel has advanced to the point where it can now be integrated with other applications to perform automated tasks such as sending multiple emails automatically through Outlook, exporting data from web pages, extracting data from servers, and so on.
MS Excel enables the user to graphically represent the data entered. This feature of excel helps us a lot when we deal with large data. In case of large data(Extending to 1000 rows) graphical visualisation always helps us analyse the data clearly.
It can be programmed to pull in data from external sources such as stock market feeds, automatically running the data through formula such as financial models to update such information in real time. Like Microsoft Word, Excel has become a de facto standard in the business world, with Excel spreadsheets frequently emailed and otherwise shared to exchange data and perform various calculations.
Resume Building- On your resume, listing additional skills that you have acquired from the Excel course can increase your probability of getting hired easily. Corporates look for people who can get the work done. The training will include building your resume with specific pointers that are helpful in corporates like tracking, designing, merging, etc.
For real-world scenarios like textual data collection, real-time analysis of fluctuating data, and automation that are a part and parcel of any industry, data-modelling on the 3-D database, rather than on the 1-D spreadsheets, is the best route to take.
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program used to store and retrieve numerical data in a grid format of columns and rows. Excel is ideal for entering, calculating and analyzing company data such as sales figures, sales taxes or commissions.
May I suggest that Microsoft Excel is an application software? It‚Äôs number one/ primary use is for spreadsheets. Those spreadsheets can be highly macroed/ automated and using pivot tables can almost function as relational databases but they are still, at core, spreadsheets.
Excel also allows multiple methods of importing and exporting data allowing it to be integrated into workflows. It also has its own programming ability to automate steps or create your own custom functions known as VBA.
Retina support: Along with the responsive design for website layouts, nowadays there is a substantial rise in designers developing for retina devices. Retina displays are twice as dense as any average LCD.
In-field labels (e.g., HTML5 placeholder): Instead of a label next to a textarea, there's grey text that fades out when you focus the field and disappears when you start typing. It saves space (particularly helpful on mobile) and puts the label right where the user's already looking.
The user should be able to get from any point A to any point B within 2-3 clicks maximum. I believe this to be the most important concept in design philosophy. Daniel Ek (Spotify founder) speaks about following this approach and Spotify is amazing when it comes to this. Compare the experience to iTunes... You will find it hard to go back to not being able to quickly click an artist's name or album on one of your playlist tracks to find a complete page of their content.
More apps are moving from stars and point based rating systems to binary (like & dislike) scales for capturing user sentiment.
Parallax: As of recent there is a big movement with parallaxing websites. Which allows the feeling of depth and dimension on a site vs simply a flat canvas, makes it a much more engaging experience if done right. (ex. http://pitch.csspiffle.com/ )
Pull-down to refresh (iOS) - On frequently updated content, a swipe down at the top of the page refreshes the content. Hidden, yes, but clever and unobtrusive.
Your Profile - There is so much information available about you from your online presence, a smart app can become more like a trusted sidekick, adding value to your situation without you having to hunt for it. A friend is more effective than a stranger
Mouseover: Underused even though they may not be as modern as others listed here. Could be used more for educating (e.g., what meaning/capability does an icon represent before I 'invest' in a click?) and content delivery (e.g., if the information I'm seeking is relatively small, just display it upon hover).
What is so new about responsive layouts?! If you've been a designer since 97, you've been doing or should have been doing responsive layouts. Just because the screen got smaller (i.e. phones and tablets) doesn't mean the expansion or reduced size of a site is anyting new. We were just making them expand or shrink according to screen resolutions or sizes, rather than devices.
In my experience, almost all "Sticky" headers/sidebar content is bad UI, and More drawers and slideouts are almost universally nasty. No doubt these things can be done well, but mostly they are not.
There was a great article by Anil Dash on how advertising should move away from page view models and focus on the streams of information that we are all exposed to (Facebook News Feed, Twitter stream). I think that has been a pretty massive change in which the navigation comes to you instead of you having to go to each separate portion of the website that you are navigating to.
I've noticed an increasing number of bold, sans-serif fonts in regard to typography and a more "flat" design. Either all-caps and all-lowercase also seem to be more prevalent. Simple icons are more common, since more people are now familiar with icons and logos enough to where text isn't needed. I've also noticed most mobile sites use the triple-lined notification button on the top-left area of the site (similar to iPhone apps).
I read a blog recently that I felt was a really good round-up, based on my experience as CTO of BestBuys.com. I actually ended up hiring the designer who wrote the blog because I liked her roundup so much!TV and other device UIs that finally utilize de facto standard interaction patterns from computing instead of jillions of buttons in weird controllers and menus from hell. Getting conformity to tried and true solutions is better than endless inventing of novelties that only tend to clutter and confuse.
well the windows 8 type metro UI is used in many websites now, of course the jQuery dialogue boxes, new forms from HTML5, awesome and 3D type buttons as of CSS3, new animation effects from CSS3 (again), bigger fonts, border radius, creative use of dropdowns, etc :D
Its all the same, nothing is really changing much in the past 30 years. In fact, we haven't really gotten anywhere. Just recently UI went back in time, it took a step back with Steve Jobs destroying Flash, which was driving the UI innovation. We now have HTML5, not so great, but gaming technologies are driving the innovation. I would take a look at games like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist. 3D Studio Max, Maya 3D, node based video editing software, database control software and hardware visual language software for interesting controls.
UI is no longer about ease of discovery. Its about pushing recommendations and suggestions to the user. What this means is that interface design is becoming more directed and active with respect to the user. Its not just about simplifying a sitemap and making it easier for a user to "find" something, like how to change my profile image. Its about understanding the user's context and pushing a notification telling them "here do this action, try this feature"
We're moving away from the web as a medium for sharing ideas and more towards a dispersed model where bits exist everywhere and can be created, shared, accessed and discovered through web browsers, apps, mobile devices, or even just moving around in the real world (think fitbit or kinect or augmented reality apps).
"Web of things". Meaning that everyday objects and locations start to have more meaning in the web. Location-based applications are a first step to this direction. This is a combination of creating artefacts that communicate through internet (like having your kitchen send you an SMS telling the stove is on, if nobody's home). Or you being able to check the content of your fridge from your mobile phone. The technology for this has been ready for a while, and hacking something like this to work with Arduino is not very difficult or expensive. I think it's more of a standard-problem and a cultural adoption problem. Meaning that no one's made a good enough product yet.
Looking at the way the social web and mobile devices have progressed, interfaces are becoming personalized. This trend will continue and the next big innovation will be in making interfaces self-learning and predictive. Interfaces that can adapt to users - devices, usage, context, location, tastes, friends, preferences, sense of art, and so on - will become more prevalent, if they are not becoming already.
A lot of the web interface design will be about these things talking to the cloud and each other and on a as needed basis, alerting me to status changes, alerts, recommendations based on rules that I set up and being there as a ready assistant when I need it.
Multi touch, gestural, voice and expression controls, enabled by new camera and micro-projection technology now becoming ubiquitous on mobile and tablet devices. You will be able to type on your TV from the sofa with no hardware using kinect-type of sensors.
you want me to answer that question? After the populairity of GUI we see a comeback of innovations in UI without the G. I think audio & speech will become more dominant in the UI designs of the comming 20 years.
I envision a situation where interface design will involve more conceptual work based on user personas. We currently use AB testing to find the best design for a particular goal, but it is becoming possible to track user trends across multiple sites thanks to the interconnectivity of the social graph. This would allow AB testing based on the USER, not the site.
Emotion-aware interfaces. Most communication is non-verbal, through facial expressions, gestures and the like. Traditionally, computers have missed that whole non-verbal component. The next interfaces, web, robotic or otherwise, will include the ability to sense how someone is feeling and adapt responses accordingly.
Spam is a technical problem, not a human one - and so is the solution. Shifting the burden onto the user is unacceptable.
Not closing with the X button. Skype doesn't close and bugger off, it just reduces and sits there in the dock mocking your impotence, your inability to make it go away. When did the X button start functioning like the -- button?
Forgot password buttons: I've just entered my email address or user name, why do I have re-enter it immediately after clicking "forgot password".
This is a very interesting question. Well, Excel is an application developed by Microsoft. It is used to record, analyze, and visualize data. Excel supports several keyboard shortcuts that you can use to speed up your work and make it more efficient.
First, the most important thing is the use of the arrow keys with control. Holding control will move you to the next "block" instead of just the next cell, which makes flying around sheets easy. Also, to move between worksheets, use control page up/down.
1E100 is a scientific notation for a very large number, meaning 1 followed by 100 zeros. There are many notations you can use for "very large number" (for example 9.999999999E+307, which is the largest number Excel recognizes), but 1E100 is much easier to remember and to type.
After Microsoft developed Excel to the 2010 version, it offered more surprises than ever. In order to deal with tons of big data, you can‚Äôt ignore the important role Excel plays in daily work. However, both for beginners and advanced users, there are still many useful tips and tricks that are inevitably overlooked. Here are 20 useful Excel spreadsheet secrets you may not know. Please note that all these functions are based on Microsoft Excel 2010.
