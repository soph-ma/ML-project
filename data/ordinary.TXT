The ongoing Russian invasion and occupation of parts of Eastern Ukraine has definitely damaged Ukraine’s economy. Until 2014, Donetsk and Luhansk regions were bringing around 15% of Ukraine’s total GDP. As a result of Russian intervention, many factories and comercial objects were destroyed by fighting and pillaging.
According to portal “League of Ukrainian real estate” , there are 371 new-built or in progress high-rise apartment complexes (was 352 in Summer), and 429 cottage and townhouses in the capital only. The apartment price on the first page starts from 42,965 USD, while Ukrainian average monthly salary is somewhat over 500 USD.
What basically means that the super-rich crooks of Ukraine continue to make bloody money, regardless of the population suffering. On one hand you see those posh houses being built.
Yes, Ukraine is spending billions of dollars on war. Money doesn’t come easy in Ukraine so they are wasting the little money they have on a pointless war they will never win. The Ukrainian military budget is $6B but the Ukrainian gdp is $152B. Ukraine has a population of 40,000,000. So that money is earned witg great difficult by millions of people who earn only hundreds of dollars each month and a large chunk like 40% of it goes to this war they won’t get any benefit from, money that could have been spent on better infrastructure, better education, etc.
Loans to Ukraine are provided from other countries. The war is now frozen, and Ukraine does not enter the territory of the militia. Basically, this is the shelling of the territory of the DPR and LPR from mortars or the seizure of small villages, as two days ago. This also affects costs. So, the war is hitting the economy, but not as much as it could.
Its the same as asking should Britain recognize knight language ?.
Ukrainian = Cossack is an invention of the 19th century, when a romantic-minded public, free from physical labor, invented different histories of nations. Then there were ideas that, for example, that the Germans are the harsh Aryans, and the Romanians are the descendants of the Romans. Well, you know all these Songs of the Nebelungs and other neo-Gothic. In Ukraine, local village intellectuals came up with the idea that Ukrainians are Cossacks. In reality, Ukrainians are the descendants of peasants. Even in the 17th century, the Cossacks did not constitute a significant part of the population.
The majority of parents don't understand that punishment is actually a poor form of discipline. It is not a good way to teach the child better behavior. For a parent, it generally comes from anger and frustration, and is a way to communicate a parent's displeasure for the child's behavior. The negative behavior will continue to occur since the consequence does not teach the child an alternative, more appropriate behavior.
Years ago, we told our kids, you can't interrupt us when we're talking to friends. But, sometimes we need to talk to you, they said. So, we created a system whereby when they need to interrupt us, they come over, stand quietly, and put a hand on our shoulder or knee.
Never a goal of ours... if you wanted to complain about a soda-straw-sleeve dart zipping past its intended target and landing in the middle of your table at the diner, I was the parent likely to treat you to a follow-up salvo. Being a Texan, rowdy suited me just fine.
I was a young single father and had a son when I was 21 (I'm 35 now). I had him half of the week every week. When my son was 3 (he's 14 now), there came a day where I was at a loss at what do when he just wouldnt listen. I ended up spanking him for the very first time and it was one of the worst days of my life emotionally. My parents had spanked me when I was young, and I vowed to never spank my son.
My wife is a school psychologist and I am an industrial psychologist, but I think that has been helpful only peripherally in raising our kids in terms of basic understanding of behavior. Most parents are clueless until they get into it, ourselves included. That said, both of our kids were first to win the "best character" awards for the first six years of their school years and we get compliments on them often. So I think we have done a good job.
There is a central irony to raising children. One of the big challenges of being a well-behaved adult is to move beyond complying with a set of rules you have learned and towards making judgement calls that are sensitive to the nuances of the situation.
To give them any X, they were asked "Would you like X?" This may sound strange to address a newborn, infant and baby in this way, but I never felt they were possessions of mine or their father's. Instead they were respected as individuals and treated with good manners. If they couldn't grasp the X I wanted to give, I asked: "Would you like me to help you hold X?" I watched their eyes. If they looked at X they got it. If they looked away or turned away from X, I put it down. And I spoke for them. I said "I see you are looking at X. I take it you mean to say, "yes, please." Or when they looked away, I said to them "you're looking away. That looks like a 'no, thank you' to me..
The secret is that the issues of discipline, self control, regard for others, fairness, patience, persistence, respect and a bunch more are all laid down as foundation in the first 5 years of your child's life.
My best advice is for the parents to demonstrate calm consistency. Say what you mean and mean what you say, so the children know exactly what to expect. Always follow through on what you said would happen (good or bad result) so then they trust and respect what you say without you yelling or repeating. Also a schedule that is normally consistent helps children to know what to do, such as having regular meal times and bedtime, chore time, home work time, etc. When there is no schedule and no consistency, chaos ensues with complaining, negotiating, and frustrations on all sides. Children need guidance and supervision to learn. Good parenting takes work.
I agree with all of the answers already written, but here's another thing that's important to know - all kids are different. I mean, they come out different. Kids aren't blank slates waiting for you to write on them - they come born with opinions, personalities, ways of expressing themselves that are different from each other and that has to factor in to how you parent them as well.
My children were rather exceptionally well behaved. Apparently, they believed I had superhuman powers. My daughter Hilary, now 30, thought I could make it rain on command, if I didn't want to drive to swim team. She told me, when she was five, that she felt like she was David and I was Goliath. My daughter Signe, now 33, would not sneak out to the mall because she assumed I knew everyone in our city and someone would report back to me. My grandson told me last year, "I heard you were tough, Grandmother. Not in a bad way, you just meant what you said." My oldest daughter appears to think I am subversive and, as a result, has rebelled by following all the rules, lol. I guess perception is something I didn't control.
Quit screaming. Go get your kid. Take that from them. Give them the threatened swat on the rear. Leave. Do whatever it is you said you would do. If you don't want to do it, don't threaten it. But whatever you threaten, DO.
When your child is unreasonable, not just misbehaving but ignoring your admonitions instead of obeying or debating you respectfully, don't treat them as a reasonable being. Stop talking to them once you're sure they're ignoring you. Switch to making them do what you asked, and make sure you do it swiftly, without emotional connection, and with as little consideration for their comfort as possible without in any way hurting them. If they have a good reason for not doing what you want, they'll soon learn to tell you with their words. It's amazing how much kids as young as three prefer to brush their teeth themselves if their parent is careful to leave only one alternative that involves the same thing they're avoiding only less fun.
Treat them from the start as people with all the rights of people. You wouldn't yell at an adult who did something against your wishes and you certainly wouldn't punish them, so why is it OK to treat children like that.
I think people don’t realize how empty South American countries are. They are huge countries with small populations.
Germany has a population of 80 million. The United Kingdom and France both have populations between 65 and 70 million. Spain is on 46 million. Italy has 60 million. There seems to be a pretty standard trend of western European nations being in the tens of millions. Even relatively small countries like the Netherlands and Belgium have over 10 million people. Right beside the UK we have Ireland. What would you guess Ireland’s population is? It’s half the size of the UK’s 70 million, so maybe 35 million? Well of course we’re talking about an answer that is surprisingly low populations, so it’d be better to low ball it. Maybe it’s at 20 million, around the same as the Netherlands? No, Ireland sits at around 5 million people (it jumps to just under 7 million if you count Northern Ireland). Looking at a population map of Europe, Ireland really stands out.
EDIT: originally this answer said “than inside the circle”, but (thanks to my weak drawing skills) the circle does include other cities like Irkutsk in Russia and Ürümqi in Xinjiang. Thanks to Gordon Chao for pointing this out. It might still be true, but it would certainly be a lot closer, and in general it’s harder to figure out population counts in an area that doesn’t follow some political boundary.
Argentina is the world’s 8th largest country, largest Spanish speaking nation in the world( yes it’s bigger than spain) area wise. And the second largest country in South America after Brazil with an area of 2,780,400 sq.km..
Why is this important? Because the global importance of Australia way outweighs the number of people. Always has. NASA beamed the 1st words from space via Australia, the UK has used Australia for 250 years as 1st a dumping ground for convicts, later to shore up the empire.
For comparison, it’s smaller than Luxembourg, usually considered right on the boundary between a microstate and a full state. It’s also smaller than Bahrain, a country less than 800 km2 in area (smaller than a large city), which is mostly arid desert.
Canada is the second largest country in the world and is the world’s 11th most influential country. It may come as a surprise to many that Canada’s population is only about 38 million, only about a tenth the population of Canada’s only neighbor, the US.
I’m not sure what the perception of the population of New Zealand is but it does have a much smaller population as compared to the two other countries which have a similar geographic profile.
Most countries in Africa, South America, Central Asia and the entirety of Australia are considerably smaller in terms of population vis à vis their size. Take a look at the pictures below where I've compared a couple of countries with my own country India which is known for it's billion plus strong population. I'd however not list Russia or Canada or Australia here, since most people already know about their tiny populations.
When I was working in TCS Trivandrum, over a breakout session, a colleague of mine had asked me if Russia was the largest country in the world, how come it was not the most populous country in the world? And not just that, it does not rank in the top 10 most populated countries in the world. Her question was why is that?.
Its area is 9,093,507 sq. KM (the second biggest country in the world behind Russia). Canada is bigger than the United States of America, China, Australia and is more than 3 times bigger than India. But Canada is just the 37th biggest country in the world in terms of the 2021 population. The current population of Canada is estimated to be 37.7 million[1] . its population is roughly equal to the population of Greater Tokyo or a little less than double the population of New York.[2] And more than half of the Canadian population just live in two provinces - Ontario and Quebec.
3/4 of the population live in cities and in central Russia. It is there that the birth rate is declining. These regions do not include any of the listed characteristics, with the exception of a decline in fertility. In other regions, this is not observed, but this does not significantly affect the fertility figures in the country.
However, change “Russia” in your question to “Poland” or “Hungary”, and it becomes more interesting. These two countries are definitely conservative, Poland is very religious (and Catholic to boot), yet they too have below-replacement birth rate. Why is that?.
Russian society is highly secular, especially compared to American society, regardless of what Russian television tells you. Many attribute that to the soviet atheist ideology, but I think, Russian society was godless, if you will, even before 1917.
If by orthodox you mean frequent churchgoers as the majority, they aren't: most Russians only mark Christmas and Easter, some try to lose weight on the Lent, and much fewer seem to pray regularly. Individualism is sadly frequent, though mentally associated with the West.
Stalin’s right hand, Lavrentiy Beriya, was a serial sexual maniac. He kidnapped, raped and killed hundreds of women. His mansion in the Moscow center is rumored to be built on their bones. This story has some truth in it, there are many stories of women disappearing without a trace after being seen with this man. And I knew a woman who managed to run away.
You may have first heard her name in the John Wick films, but she was the essence of my childhood nightmares. Her forest hut has chicken legs, and she eats misbehaving children and lost wanderers.
The whole recorded History of Russia itself creepier than any myth or story anyone could come up with. Just open the History book and read. If that is not creepy enough for you, nothing would be.
it is one of the wealthiest families in America, and their estimated fortune is $ 11 billion, placed in trust funds scattered here and there. Beginning with John D. Rockefeller, the first American billionaire who became rich after founding Standard Oil in 1870, the family worked hard to get everything they had.
We are so tiny and inconsequential in the universe, it’s not even funny.
This is how my first friend looks like. He works in a small company as a salaried worker.
In his prime days, with a simple roar, he made the whole group of wild beasts freeze in fear, but now he is in his old age. He can barely move, let alone hunt. Look at his ribs. Look how thin he is. He knows it is the end. In some way, I see the picture of this lion similar to the age-old monk. This lion is so calm and looking straight in the eyes of death. He doesn’t scream, He is simply waiting for the next minute when everything is gonna be alright. No more pain. No more hunger. He tries his best to stand. He fought a valiant battle, till the end.
Vulture scratch dead bodies to fill it's stomach after death but we are scratching living people to fill our vaults, where will we take such wealth or for whom?.
On their way, there was a river with no bridge. They have to cross the river by walk. So they have decided to walk across the river. At the same time, there was a young beautiful lady at the river side who also needed to cross the river. She asked for help to the monks. So the elder among the two, carried her on his back and helped her cross the river.
6 months passed, my brother was now 6 months old, one day my maa noticed that my brother donot responds to any visual input , whenever we swing our hand infront of him he donot respond to it , so we consulted to doctor in aiims to know what actually is the reason ...
In general terms what it has looked like for me and others is being open and vulnerable (incrementally) about my feelings towards my therapist and the sadness and fears that experience evokes in me. That is often then tied back to experiences in my childhood and youth where I may have experienced those feelings or longings before. We discuss my fears and my sadness about unmet needs from my younger years and how those unmet needs relate to my current experience of being with my therapist.
A man sees a snake dying in flames and decides to free it from the fire. As soon as he catches it, the snake bites him causing excruciating pain. The man immediately drops the snake and the reptile falls back into the burning flames.
Despite having no money,no food and no shelter this Syrian girl manages to have the biggest heart...
This is because of his power obtained since he was first elected 16 years ago. He has a shady “mafia-style” labyrinth of personal connections and deals, and he is in the middle of uncontrollable corruption circle.
Women generally think that men are more attractive if they see another woman smiling at that man.
You may think that this guy likes me, but why doesn’t he look at me, but always looks at things next to me, with a thoughtful look on his face. At this time, you can be bold Look into his eyes. If he really has a crush on you, he will either dare not look at you and his face will turn slightly red, or he must have the courage to look at each other with an expression of'Are you looking for me?'.
Confidence is everything: even money and personality is what it looks like. So, even if you are at least in front of your crush and not comfortable, pretend to be comfortable.
Girls are masters at reframing experiences to justify their actions. They said “no" based on emotion, not logic. Later, they justify that no. If the guy doesn't ask again, it's “if he really wanted me he'd ask again.” If the guy does ask again, it's, “see, what a loser! If he's so desperate he has to ask the same girl twice, why would I want to date him?”.
Never seek approval from your crush. Most people especially men will always try to act very funny to seek attention of her attention. That's for wimpy men. And they treated like clowns. Friendzoned. So sad. Be a real Man. And seek your own approval.
If a girl likes you, she will deliberately act like a coquettish in front of you. These performances are unique to girls. Moreover, a girl would only act like a baby boy she likes. The babbling noise they make in front of you is just suggesting that they like you. Like "Take a small fist to punch your chest" is a kind of coquettish performance.
But did you know that their heart is doing the same thing too? That’s because scientists found out that couple’s breathing patterns and heart rate match up when they are sitting close to each other.
We have heard this a million times and it is also scientifically proved that opposite poles do attract each other in terms of a magnet. But is it true in terms of a human being’s feelings? Chances are that you will get attracted to the very opposite person of yourself quite easily. What is it they say about chemistry? Oh yeah, it does cook up a nice reaction here.
It is scientifically proven that a woman may take up to 15 days or more to fall in love with another person, whereas a man hardly takes 8.2 seconds. Sigh! No wonder love at first sight examples are more often than not given by Men.
Never look for endorsement from your crush. The vast majority particularly men will consistently attempt to act extremely entertaining to look for consideration of her consideration. That is intended for weak men. What's more, they dealt with like comedians. Friendzoned. So dismal. Be a genuine Man. Furthermore, look for your own endorsement.
You may think that this guy likes me, but why doesn’t he look at me, but always looks at things next to me, with a thoughtful look on his face. At this time, you can be bold Look into his eyes.
If you think that giving ordinary underwear is too old-fashioned, then choose sexy underwear. Find a time when it looks like you don’t want to have sex, such as when you are eating in a restaurant, hand it to her under the table and ask her to change it in the bathroom.
It is a powerful mixture of idealization and infatuation. The brain chemicals associated with crushes can wreak havoc (or pure bliss, depending on your point of view) on a person for up to two years. If a powerful crush lasts longer than two years, it may actually be what psychologists call limerence.
Crushes often happen to teenagers and resemble puppy love. It's often more infatuation than true love and can be short lived or long term until the person reaches their 20s when the crush subsides.
Let me introduce you with the problem that emotionally destroy people in long term relationships.
Many women nowadays want love from their husbands but complain about them all the time, and undermine them.
Even though we often think of ourselves as a faithful species, we’re not the only one in the animal kingdom. Wolves, swans, gibbons, black vultures, albatrosses and even termites are just a few of those animals that find a mate for a lifetime.
Relationship does not start in the manner as you want .At earlier stage of relationship you tried too hard to appease the people you love.Later his value diminish ,some may not agree on this but this is harsh reality. At starting of relationship you ignore their mistakes but after few months you starts noticing pity things. You care about her feeling,desires and ambitions but later you only matters your priorities ,same thing happens with men also.Most of the people love but don't marry to their love.
Chemical responsible for connection is oxytocin , that’s chemical that makes you feel connection and in large doses even love.
Disgust is a true relationship killer, if somehow this happens in a relationship it is a huge red flag.
There was over 50,000 and people couldn’t breathe and some people were quite literally getting stomped on and jumped on.
Of course, dogs are really loyal animals (excluding my dog who seems to have a distaste for me) but using this pup’s appearance for upvotes is just wrong. Please factcheck before posting… I mean look that one piece of fake information has more upvotes than most of the answers I’ve seen!.
Sonu Sood Sir who helped migrants selflessly during Covid-19 without any support does not get any honor from the Central government but one who spread hateness in the society got fourth highest civilian award ‘Padma Shri’.
The Point is if she quit the glam world then why is she even posting all this. I think the religion forbids to showcase. According to Islam clicking and displaying of pictures is Haram. So what is she even trying to prove? You are religiously following your religion ..good but showing it off like hypocrite?.
All across Afghanistan, the Taliban are in advance. They conquer provincial capital after provincial capital, overcoming the far better-armed and better-trained government forces with shocking ease. Wherever they arrive, they slaughter those they consider “enemies of the people”. Among these are the interpretators who worked for foreign forces during 2001–2021.
After NASA posted a picture of Pratima and Puja Roy, Hinduphobia comments began to pour in based on their background. The murtis that they chose to adorn their workspace with became a target for Hinduphobes who criticized her religious preferences. See the below images.
Last night I took care of a drunk driver in a Hummer who mowed down children, pregnant women, the sick and the elderly on city streets. Many of these people died. Others were maimed for life. He himself is only mildly injured and will recover fully.
Today, I was at my father's shop. My dad runs a medical store. He was out for some work and I had to sit at his place for some time.
He angrily shouted at me to either charge 170 rupees or 160 rupees. I was really angry at this that I gave him a 3 rupees discount and he is still not satisfied.
I saw this post today on one of my friend’s story, and after seeing this I got furious. I don’t know why, teens nowadays think that making fun of academic students is very cool (but indeed, it isn’t). I know that things other than studies are also important, but you can’t just underestimate people who want to achieve something in their life by their academic performance. They just think that being active on social media, specially in their teens is known as being ahead in life.
Instead ,he made an effort to interview the people who are getting most affected due to the lockdown.
The worrying thing here is even Teenagers and People in their 20s actually believe that Modi is gonna give then Akhand Hindu rashtra and countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Singapore, Thailand etc will surrender to us and Dream of Hindu Rashtra will turn into reality. It would be still understandable if Whatsapp uncles in their 50s think about this but our young generation too.
When complaints bore no results, she shot a video on 16th October, and posted on social media(facebook). The video went viral the same day and the authorities redid the repair work there a few hours later.
But the problem is that when a student takes reference of these memes for their failure this makes me really angry. They think that saying “proud to be backbencher” Would make them look cool and would get them respect and attention but they don't even realise how fool and dumb they sound when they say these things.
No, I don't have a problem with Mahatma Gandhi's picture being there on our currency. It's the condition of most notes in circulation that makes me feel angry. I'm a germophobe, or so say most people who've met me. Thus as a result everytime someone hands me a tattered and soiled note or a pitch black five rupee coin I feel really irritated.
I received my Myntra order today at around 1pm(13th July,2021). I paid the delivery guy and he went. After I had my lunch,I curiously opened the package.To my surprise,the package was closed with a transparent cellotape. Back of my mind,I already knew something was fishy.
Gordon has been teaching this semester online as the COVID lockdown caused colleges to end in-classroom teaching.
What made me angry is that Rainn Wilson is right. America over the past fifty years has changed Jesus from a kind man who loved everyone, healed the sick and fed the poor to become an unrecognizable symbol of wealth and politics. And it makes me angry because it’s a lie.
Taking the example of the name of this effect, each of the members of a group of cheerleaders or "cheerleaders" enhances the beauty of the others, making them look prettier or more beautiful.
But I’ve been around for seven decades, how about you? It sounds like you haven’t yet learned that beautiful looks don’t equal beautiful behaviors.
Your premise is false, and the converse (ugly-looking people are mostly horrible people) is absolutely false, also. Please exercise some compassion and common sense before disparaging and harming people. I urge you to open your mind to a more accurate reality.
Years ago, I had a peeping tom at my apartment. After the initial shock, I called the police to file a report. Two officers came into my living room with a giant three ring binder and slapped it open. In a sea of photos, I was tasked to find the perp. What I noticed immediately was that every single man in those photos was either very unattractive or mildly attractive but disheveled with a halo of down-on-his-luck. And while I didn’t spot the familiar face who hours earlier was peering into my bedroom window, I developed a feeling of empathy for him.
Wrong philosophy. There are plenty of sociopaths, psychopaths, and narcissists who are good-looking, polite, and even charming. Don’t let them deceive you, pay attention to people’s actions, not looks or words.
This is a totally ridiculous wild generalisation. Have you ever heard the phrase “beauty is only skin-deep”? This means that a person, usually refering to a woman may be pretty but they have a horrible personality or are very fake as people. Ivanka Trump is an one example of an ugly person beneath her attractive exterior. Ditto Tomi Loren.
They are not, it is just perception. There are various physical appearance across different persons of all characters. The person happens to be single out. Some people have other qualities to cover up/make up for their flaws, in that person's case his physical appearance was not far from the character.
I used to think there was no obvious connection between the two, but then I learned about the role that testosterone plays in both physical attractiveness and personality traits like narcissism or psychopathy.
But in the middle ground your personality can draw your visage in the direction of your mind. A plain face can be beautiful if that person is bright eyed and smiling all the time. On the other side a bitter person will often make faces and distort their features the opposite way.
In my opinion, the essence of love is that you like each other. Although you have quarrels and complaints, you still hold the firm belief that you are willing to build a happy home together.
Love is our unbridled lying in the sofa in the living room. Although we are playing with mobile phones, we are embracing each other. Watch TV together and show you your shirt as my new dress.
Be mature. Handle yourself. Don't overpamper each other. Scold each other in private, say, when the guests leave and never hesitate to apologise first. Keep loving, keep growing.
I have never been in a relationship. Please read till the end if I had written anything wrong about it, you can mention it in the comment box.
I have planned things with her friends but called them that she is too tired and slept and it’s tough to wake her up so will do something tomorrow.
When fancy treats get replaced by one cup of tea, balcony/terrace & sweet nothings.
When a french court tried an Afghan immigrant 'Mohammed Arsala’ for sexually assaulting a 12yr old boy, his lawyer tried to Argue that Arsala should not be held responsible for his actions because men sexually assaulting young boys was a common practice in his homeland of Afghanistan.
Conversely, I grew up with a local and familial tradition of civic-mindedness. One was expected to help out one’s neighbors. Growing up in Vermont with harsh winters, this tradition also served a useful purpose. If you needed help you could reach out to the community for aid. But when others reached out, you were expected to pitch in too. To this end, I have participated in two barn-raisings, which seems almost unique amongst men my age. I have further continued to maintain this tradition throughout my adult life, and I see no reason to change.
If there is a benefit in something, whether it’s tradition or not, carry on doing it, else drop it. If you’re going to follow a tradition do it for the benefit, not for the sake of the tradition.
Most people in my family are not very religious. Yet at Christmas (or around that time), we meet up each year, it’s tradition.
We should do things because they have merit, not because we should be condemned to repeat the ignorance of past mistakes.
Very much so. It’s a capsule of collective learning through thousands of years of trial and error. Today we write our laws down and have a reason for each of them. Tradition is the same. Sometimes they seem hard and archaic. We even go a step further and believe their age makes them less relevant. But the people before us were human too, and if they decided to govern themselves in a harsh way, they had a reason.
If you decide not to rely on it in any way, you are essentially forced to re-invent the sum total of human civilization in your single lifetime. This is not merely impossible: if you decide to do it, you will find that your energy is largely spent re-discovering the past as opposed to charting out the future.
When viewing many different cultures, it is obvious that some traditions from civilized groups are important and should be given on to the next generation. Some other traditions are from primitive and in some cases mentally ill groups and should be discarded. Sometimes, when viewing a strange culture, a group will exaggerate and ridicule that tradition, and make it sound terrible, when it is not. So it is important to just view and comment on your own traditions and not those of other cultures.
The etymology of the word, as is often the case with concepts like this, is probably the most important clue. The word "tradition" comes from Latin trans- "across" + dare "to give," which combined to form the word tradere, meaning "to deliver," with secondary meanings such as "to communicate" or even "to unintentionally give away information," like the word "betray" in the sense of "His body language betrayed his true feelings.".
In the Hindu philosophy, the cow is sacred because of three reasons. One, it feeds on grass which itself is a regenerative source of raw material. Two, the cow gives milk freely regardless of who the person who is milking her is. She doesn’t discriminate. And three, the gift of a cow — go-daan — means the person who owns a cow doesn’t have to depend on anyone for fuel (cow dung) or food (milk). Thus, treating the cow as a sacred animal was (and is) belief driven.
Traditions are passing on the knowledge to next generation. I feel good and relevant traditions are important to keep the important information about ourself and our ancestry while the irrelevant and allogical (to present time) are only good to be discarded to keep the value and worth safe.
Traditions are passed down and continued precisely because they have value. They would not have become traditions if people of the past did not find value in them. It doesn’t mean they will always have value to future generations though.
Taking care of children, the sick and elderly, finding and cooking food, building shelter, recording History, teaching social skills, taking care of nature, and learning from mistakes are important traditions.
It is important to the society for the people get a glimpse of how life used to be before the storm of technologies, modernization and everything else came. Cultural traditions play a significant role especially to the younger generation, allowing them to take a breath from the high standards and extreme pressure of today’s society. They also hold genuine identities and originalities that will provide help to break through the counterfeits of fraud, and make a diversion to the influence of this constantly changing era.
Of course it is - or rather, they are: traditions are multiple. Another name for tradition is culture, or “the way we do things around here” - for any values of “we” and “here.” When in Rome, do as the Romans. OR be prepared to take the consequences. which will be varied, but mostly negative: you will not be understood, your motives will be questioned, you will generate disagreements, what you think is trivial could well be a major matter, and you will be in the wrong - aha, ecco polizzia - try to explain it to them !.
Tradition is part of carrying on rituals that were deemed of importance from long ago. But the more we advance as a race , the more we break from original traditions and in so doing recreate traditions to fit our modern time. An example is marriage .. 15 years ago gay marriage was not recognized as a legal due to the traditional sense of marriage. Now it is recognized in our society.
People use different ways to convey their message to everyone Sometimes by order and sometimes by request but what did the member of Mexican parliament done was truly unexpected and definitely it makes the worth of his words.
There was a tall, lanky fellow who always wore long sleeves and sat down the table from me in engineering class. He didn’t talk much, had a strange sneeze and mostly kept to himself.
A few years ago I was with the almost billionaire that I have mentioned in some other Quora posts.
“It’s in the eyes, Asim. I could see them sparkle when he was listening, learning. I can sense he’s hungry to know more. The intelligent person knows the power of knowledge and so hungers for it, is excited by it.”.
These people are not naturally more intelligent. They’re better learners which makes them more intelligent.
The voice seemed familiar and his parents were yelling at each other. He asked them to sit back in the car and we drove back to home.
Say to the person something that would challenge his/her beliefs, such as, “I think the global warming is a hoax”, or “I think Trump will be a great president”. An intelligent person will respond with questions. They will ask: “What made you think so?”, and listen patiently to your arguments. An intelligent person will challenge you with questions: “Have you thought about this?”, or “Are you familiar with this research?”.
If I tell someone about an interesting article I read, most people will ask me if I read that magazine a lot, or tell me about someone they know who also reads that magazine. An intelligent person will ask me about the content of the article. A very smart person will add something relevant that they have read. An extremely smart person will make an observation about the subject matter that no one has even considered.
Because the profoundly gifted process information so quickly, they absorb large amounts of factual and observational data and are capable of understanding abstract connections and patterns. If you get one going they will quickly leave you scratching your head trying to catch up. Luckily, most are very kind and if they have the time and patience will let you ask stupid questions to make sense of what they are saying.
I’ve been lucky enough to have known a lot of truly brilliant people who have accomplished great things in the world. I’m not sure how many of them even know their IQs, but (with a couple of weird exceptions) they certainly don’t go around bragging about it. If anything, they think it’s kind of funny, or part of a story about how they ended up in some special program as a kid — or didn’t, because they tested low.
An intelligent person should be able to use the knowledge he has to solve problems. Problem solving is a critical skill that tells how intelligent someone is.
I don’t think you can — not easily. For every criterion that we associate with high IQ, there are exceptions. For one thing, many people with high IQ’s have become accustomed to hiding their intellect. But, for what it’s worth.
I’m reminded of a funny story about some professor at Cambridge—I don’t know if it’s true, but I read it in the internet so it must be true.
The other is just there listening and making a huge effort to understand. Every now and then, he asks the explainer about something he said, or he rephrases or reframes what he heard to see if he is understanding correctly. He might even ask how the explainer came to that conclusion.
Here are some characteristics I have found in the very high IQ people I’ve met although these are, of course, generalizations that will have some counterexamples. High IQ people are.
Sometimes, for example, Mensa members are really insulted because people believe they are obsessed with bragging about their IQ. In fact Mensa members tend to be the last people on earth who'd do that, in my experience. It's more that they feel they don't fit anywhere, and a high IQ has actually caused them some issues. Mensa meetings are often a great place to meet the most diverse, down to earth people you'll have met in a long time.
Nobody had to tell her that she lacked intelligence, she already was aware of it, and this is how she knew: People are social creatures. They get together in groups and talk and joke around. My sister would be sitting with a group of kids and somebody would crack a joke and…. everybody would laugh. Inside, my sister would think and think about that joke, and just not understand what was funny. But she’d laugh anyway, because the first couple times it happened, and she didn’t laugh, somebody looked at her and commented that “Kat didn’t get the joke!” and the laughter would change into something that just made her feel bad about herself.
You need to observe and look for following traits. Your observation of them should be deep and detailed and not just cursory. List their characteristics you compile from observation and then compare those with following and see how many traits match. If someone has all or most of these traits, you can easily consider them to be very intelligent. But for most part you need to look for the level of awareness in them. Best measure of intelligence is the level of awareness.
Many people's thinking is not logical, it is scattered, it is dotted, it can not form linear logical thinking. Linear logical thinking is the first step of basic logical ability, basic thinking ability, basic wisdom and basic intelligence.
There was this girl in class who could’ve been a poster child for ADHD (“Did you hear that about… omg such a cute butterfly… so, we should instead go and… but what is for dinner again?” — all that within a span of about 3.7 seconds.) Most people didn’t think much of her, but we were pretty close friends so I had a good idea she was a lot more than she looked. One day, the teacher cracked a joke. She started laughing at it a good half second earlier than anybody else. I took that as proof that my suspicion about her intelligence was correct. I never had to revise my opinion.
Truly intelligent people are not irritated or offended by less intelligent people. They recognizing that all populations are naturally comprised of people with ranges of intelligences, upbringings, and experiences. In public they may poke gentle fun at a truly stupid idea so as not to embarrass its author. In private, they may suggest alternatives to a stupid idea.
It is easy to confuse intelligence with credentials (academic qualifications), knowledgeability (knowing a lot), learnability (ability to learn new things), and passion for abstract thinking (interested in meta-cognitive reflection, etc.) I know of many people who went to top universities, who excelled in international tests and state exams, who did very well professionally, and pursued high ranks in academia. But to me, all of these are not definitive hallmarks of a person's intelligence: if you are lucky enough to have above average cognitive ability, a high amount of drive, and was born in a supportive environment that encouraged learning - all these traditional indicators of intelligence would not be hard to achieve.
They don’t talk about how much they know - It was perhaps the Buddha who said “Those who speak do not know, those who know do not speak.” The more you learn the more you understand how little you know. A solid mark of an ignorant buffoon is their willingness to tell you how much they know about something. Intelligent people tend not to pontificate (ironic then that I have so many Quora answers).
Usually highly intelligent individuals will not be boasting about it. They may be the most quiet ones in the room. When they do speak, they are clear and concise and use a good vocabulary. They don’t try to speak so that other people can’t understand them. They can explain ideas simply because they understand it so well. They don’t try to make others feel stupid for not knowing something. Hi IQ people do read a lot of a wide array of reading materials. They are constantly learning something new.
Keep in mind not everyone stays in one 'lane' all night but yes you can tell if you're surrounded by morons by the substance of the information they're passing along.
Well, being that I am a 60 year old man who is in decent shape, I think I can offer you some information. First, we, well me anyway, think about sex. First and last thought of the day. That's been the case since I was 12 years old.
My father is 87 years old and still in good health, except for his eyesight. So I think about what I would like to do for the next 30 years (and I take the vitamins that will preserve my eyesight..
Some 60-year-olds think about their mortality. They see death approaching and they panic. They divorce their devoted wife who has put up with them for 35 years and seek out a pretty young gal who is willing to act like an air-head and be arm candy in exchange for nice clothes and some jewelry. It’s pathetic.
Am I going to be able to get out of bed today :) I think about the same things I’ve always thought about, women, sex, what’s going on with my job , what’s going on with my hobbies, what is my workout body part tonight, man I wish I could win the lottery and retire!! Then I think about my bucket list and what I would do with some of the money after investing most of it. How are my kids doing and what’s going on in their life. Damn, where did all the years go. It seems like yesterday I was sitting in High School and thinking the year 2000, seemed like an eternity away. Wow did that come and go fast. Just a few things a 60 year old thinks about.
I’ll quote Hasan Nisar Sahib, “ You have used all your 500 and 1000 bill and only change is left”. I don’t plan anything. I’ve seen enough of the life in this world. Come to a point where I think I am nothing. Everything is happening as preplanned . I’m just here. Mother Nature have blessed me more than I deserve. Sometimes get upset by thinking about the minor (no major) errors happened in life and feel responsible for that. Jesus said that kingdom of God is in your heart. True. You are the victim, prosecutor witness and Judge. Only you know truth about you, no one else knows. I’m not in a hurry to leave but ready to leave this world any moment. Have no enemy. Don’t feel jealous for others prosperity but feel little worried when arrogant people prosper. Let me stop here and take a break. Rest later on……love y’all.
This would be an impossible question to answer because every person varies as to how they tolerate things so me being a female I may tolerate something like this way but you the wife might tolerate it a different way. It’s really going to depend on how each body reacts to whatever it’s doing! For example I have depression and anxiety I’ve had it since I was 18 that may alter me and not alter somebody else in that department because I already suffer from that so my body is more susceptible to being altered may be before somebody else’s who might be perfectly normal in that department.
Yesterday, in Portmore, Jamaica, a 20 year old female's body was found, dead, near a fishing area, with a rope around her neck, and some of her garments missing, including her underwear.
Yes. It is possible to transmit it orally. It may be communicated by kissing or sexual intercourse. Transferring in this manner does not cause the receiver to get high, but it does enter their system. The quantity conveyed varies depending on how it is done and how long a person is exposed. The quantity transported in certain circumstances is so little that it is undetected. In certain situations, it might result in failed drug tests.
No so what if you know your triggers they will not stop the emotional responses. Im going to give you the process to heal. I would say first express the memory as art draw it. That will trigger the trauma. Now create an experience that contradicts the traumas expectations. “Due to the entirely nonverbal nature of the limbic brain, experiential rather then cognitive methods are required for successfully engaging and changing its schemas.” (Ecker, B., 2011). “A dynamic neural process now known as reconsolidation can actually unlock the synapses maintaining implicit emotional learnings” (Nader, K., et al. 2000). (Pansskepp, J., 1998). The amygdala compares current perceptions to these attachment related implicit memories triggering a self-protective response. When the child is at his/her worst behavior an opportunity for healing is created only if caregivers understand what is happening as a process. One can see how difficult this can be because the normal response by caregivers is counterintuitive. So then what is the solution?.
If you aren’t into standard techniques you may want to look at hypnosis, it works well for PTSD and it doesn’t take years. There is a technique of repeated exposure until a person no longer responds to the fear trigger, however this is more common for phobias than PTSD and isn’t universally liked as it works sometimes but far from all the time. A phobia can be instilled without an experience (ie a parents fear) PTSD always has a muscle memory attached and that is what needs to be dealt with.
Exposure therapy can help in some cases, but can also exacerbate the issue if not done correctly. Honestly I would seek cognitive behavioral therapy- you can actually get a lot better.
Hi Shania, it’s an extremely good idea. Lean in. It’s a tough time for people trying to find therapists, and even harder when it comes to PTS (I leave the disorder part out because it is a natural development from trauma). You can even do EMDR yourself, there are YouTube videos, it’s a brilliant technology (requiring no actual technology) based on cross neural patterning. You know how taking a long walk can help process? It is the same principle. It’s certainly far from ideal, you could really benefit from having a compassionate witness involved, but absolutely yes you can examine your triggers, and if you lean in and challenge yourself, you can definitely make inroads.
If you have never been to a group meet up for PTSD, you should go a few times. The people there will understand what you are up against better than anyone else could. They might not be of too much practical help, but sometimes you just need people on your side.
People do weirdest things most of times knowingly but also many times unknowingly because they never expected that it could be happened in such a way. So always be aware from such insane activities.
I think this was the most enjoyable thing that we all have done in our childhood when there was Facebook or other social apps were newly created and we don't have much friends over there so we started creating fake IDs mostly people created fake IDs on the name of girls because everyone wanna be the friend of girl not a boys so now when I remember those days of my childhood that's truly made me a smile and happy moments come in front of my eyes.
How weird is it that people are getting enjoyed by being roasted and saying to others please roast me, it's so weird but also common now a days because by getting roasted Maybe they feel happy and a smile came on their faces by reading such funny lines about themselves.
Mostly actresses got stuck by their openly views or opinions about different controversial topics but it also happens due to the jealousy of other personalities such as the Queen of beauty the gorgeous Bella Hadid. That's always comes on news for her perfect looks.
I don't like such people who are just made for criticism and degrading the people to do not achieve their goals and dreams such as this gorgeous and sexy lady who is underrated icon, Jennifer Coolidge and her super performance that won the hearts of her fans and lovers.
Art is the one of the best descovery of hundreds and the thousands of years in the history cause the best artist and painters were always been admired in the history and the made shocked everyone by the precious and priceless statues and paintings that have ever made. There are hundreds of shocking facts and myths in the history that people believe blindly. So the image below itself shows the historical fact.
These visuals are really shocking to me that what type of minds were there in old age cause all the amazing arts, calligraphy and such a unique architecture of different shapes and statues made us amazed the life of that time and the rulers who ruled and did their best in the past history.
First off, he probably won't. Kids these days live in a very different world from the one we lived in as kids. My son is 12 and has very long hair and long nails. Nobody teases him, but adults often mistake him for a girl, and you know what? He doesn't care. Because he knows that there is no such thing as girl things and boy things anymore, and even if there were, there's nothing shameful about being “girly” because girls and boys are equals.
Long hair isn’t really “girly” anymore - but it is his hair, his choice. Let him grow it out and IF he actually does get teased, and it bothers him so much he can always get it cut short if/when he wants. It is JUST HAIR - whatever is done with it, it will always grow back. My 17 year old has worn his hair long for the past 3 years or so, and he has never been bothered by such teasing. Teaching your son to love himself and be happy with who he is and how he looks, and not be bothered by other people’s opinions about such shallow things will be better for him than just telling him to avoid doing things because he “might” get teased about it.
Well im a 26 year old man with long hair that goes down to around the middle of my back and I've worn it in almost every different way imaginable, ive even worn loose pigtails before and im a perfectly straight male so i know how bad the teasing can get. However, you must not lose sight of what is truly important here, the question, is your son happy doing what he does? If the answer is yes, then don't try to change him, be there to support him in his decisions.
You should see the quelling looks he gives guys who give him a hard time about going into the men's bathroom - he's definitely a boy. Indeed he will wear things simply to annoy guys who give him a hard time about it - you don’t like this? Wait until he shows up tomorrow with his skateboard, basketball and a purple unicorn shirt. I know he does it intentionally cuz he tells me about. He thinks the reaction of the men being even more annoyed is funny and likes annoying them more for being jerks.
Long hair isn’t girly. Let him grow his hair long. All you’re doing is perpetuating out of date stereotypes. And if he get teased, let him. It thickens the skin. Be a role model and don’t tease him yourself. There is no gendered hair style. Hair is just hair.
I have always believed in letting the kids, have the hair they want, as long as its neat and clean and looks like its been cut recently . Its really not harming anyone, and I think it violates them, when they are forced, to cut their hair, when they don't want to. They need to be respected as people. Their are more important things to worry about.
My son wanted to grow his hair, at about the same age. The mullet was in then and he grew his hair. He also got called a girl, his hair was white blonde and curly had beautiful hair. He did cut his hair after that, but it was his choice. I always let my son do what he wanted with his hair, its only hair and it grows back.
My mother always kept my hair very short as a kid and I hated it. Kids need to be individuals and make their own choices.
As a parent, it your job to teach your child how to manage opinions that don't agree with his without allowing them to effect his self esteem or confidence. You can tell him that he may be teased, but also help him come up with responses to being teased because teasing a male for having long hair is closed minded and an antiquated social view. You can encourage him to be who he wants to be no matter what others think of him. And you can prepare both of you for the responses from the people who love it.
I’m sure other boys might side-eye his long hair. But as a youth in that age range I was far more into boys who grew long hair. Almost all my young lady friends agreed, as long as the long hair was kept and washed it added incredible appeal.
That’s gonna be tough to sell, since almost no one will actually see it as “girly”. Back in the sixties, when long hair on a dude kinda meant something culturally, the only criticism I got was from adults, whose opinions I didn’t really care about. “Who cares what the squares think?”, pretty much summed it up for me.
I suggest not making fun of him for having girly hair. Growing your hair long takes a lot of patience. And he’s probably just testing his limits with you and how much she can get away with and have control of. I suggest being supportive of it in a sense that you’re not telling him that he can’t do it but you’re putting it on him. My guess is that he’ll grow tired of it sooner rather than later. Tell him that if he grows it long enough he’s got a Jerry curl it, then tell him how luxurious it is every time you see him. Say “ damn son those Jerry curls look real nice. Real Lionel Richie, Real luxurious. Damn I’m not jealous.”.
I'd just make him reconsider having it by joking with him! Just be sarcastic and say something like “oh right! You planning on becoming the next model for a Loreal tv advert are you”. He'll either see the funny side and just accept it and move on or he'll have second thoughts haha.
My grandson has had long hair since he was very young because he likes long hair. It was getting quite long and straggly (he is 12 now) and I have told him that it is too long and to trim it. He has been mistaken for a girl a few times, usually by older ladies. I’m sure he gets teased now and then in school but he does not let it bother him since he knows what he wants and is self-assured. He has lots of friends and usually makes friends instead of enemies. I’m also sure he has been bullied a few times, but he stands up for himself.
My 12 year old brother has hair almost down to his collarbones. He isn’t teased at all. In fact, the other kids think he looks hip, and I agree. He’s been teased a couple of times but the majority of his friends love his hair. As for the times he’s been teased? He doesn’t give a flying crap about it. Some kids just aren’t phased by a little tease here and there.
If you are struggling to acquire a reply for How will the coronavirus affect the world economy? this after that you can stop worrying. I have seen this questions next many times in the hours of daylight in Quora. The solution is easy you can use this tool to acquire the results.
I started my business 27 years ago. We survived the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 crisis in Asia, the Y2K crisis, the 2001 Dot Com bubble, the 2008 financial meltdown, and many political crises along the way.
The supply chain beginning in China has been temporarily disrupted. Those impacts, which began in February, will take about three months to be felt here in the US. That puts the first pain in May, even if the virus disappears by then. For somethings, like washing machines and furniture, it may not be so incredibly bad as those purchases are non-perishable. But if you are a store that sells “N” units of those products and you can no longer get them, then you’re next step is to cut back on labor you don’t need to sell, deliver, install and maintenance the product. And that’s just for non-critical items.
There are two ways. Inflation and sovereign debt. First means a lot of pissed off people losing their savings. Second is even worse meaning hyperinflation because entire governments can collapse… But it can go both ways simultaneously as well… and to describe that I’d like to share a revelation if I may.
If you are not hibernating in a cave, you can already see many impacts of the virus. There has been and will be massive unemployment as people pull in their horns and stop going out in public. All kinds of economic production will be disrupted, and buyers will not have money with which to buy.
India's manufacturing sector have come down from 12% to 0.5%. Indian textile industry has played a vital role in decreasing the economy of India and I would say the government is ignoring the slowdown in our core sector.Wait I have a proof.
Some people will blame demonetization and GST. Not me. The adverse effect of demonetization and poor GST implementation are now irrelevant. They are history. And so are Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, in case you are looking in the past for someone or something to blame.
Every economy has its cycle for expansions, troughs and recoveries. In Indian case the typical recovery cycle is 3 years long [12 quarters] and the most recent recovery started in the mid of 2013. After 3 years, in mid 2016 we reached a peak in growth and there is a drop in growth.
Yes you read it right because a section of media which has lost its credibility on many occasions is hell bent on creating a impression that Bharat is suffering from a slow down. They are peddling the nefarious agenda of many different players.
Media does not point out that this year in March 2019, highest GST collection was recorded but a comparative reduction is made a sensational headline.
Look at the epic reaction of the members on the Treasury Benches in the Rajya Sabha when their own finance minister Ms.Nirmala Sitharaman was trying to make some forceful points.
I want to ask the government about the economic mess, not Ram Mandir, Hindu Muslim, Cow, Lynching....but only and only about the lies that were told on the economic front? GDP, Joblessness, Industrial distress, NPA's?.
As a result, prices are escalating quickly (which is good for some of us), but personally, I sense something is getting out of control.
If you look at history, that has always happened, even after the Great Plague which killed over half of Europe. But which economy? And for how long?.
Well let’s spend some time on the premise of your question, as I don’t believe that with 88,000 US coronavirus deaths (and counting) and 36 MILLION unemployed Americans that the coronavirus will “blow over”. Even if there was a “summer miracle” as President Trump would have you believe (“It’ll just disappear.”) or that they’ll be a readily available vaccine by election day, sorry to burst your bubble, but it just ain’t gonna happen! As for the economy booming, I’m no F&B economic expert, but when restaurateurs tell me that they are working on very slim margins and need to fill their seats to at least 80% capacity to be profitable and cover expenses, I find it very hard to see them staying around with only 50% maximum capacity. And what about all those smaller F&B outlets that somehow had to fire all their workers and somehow weren’t able to tap in to our government’s PPP program, they are already history, no money to pay the lease their businesses are already gone forever.
trump has been trying to convince voters that the US economy will bound back "like a rocket," more robust than ever after the battle with coronavirus. Conversely, there is an explanation as to why economics is known as the "dismal science." There are developing signs that any recuperation will neglect to synchronise the speed and gravity of the economic breakdown that occurred in barely a few weeks.
However, here's the tricky bit: who will benefit, and who will lose? In the wake of the Great Recession, we saw strong, consistent, gradual recovery that left behind those without postsecondary educations and communities of color and rural communities.
The US economy generates roughly $2 trillion per month on average in overall economic activity as measured by GDP. The Wuhan virus panic impacted about 40% of the economy for a period of what will hopefully be about four months - this is roughly $3.2 trillion in lost GDP. In a sense, what we’ve done is taken the US economy back to the size it was under George Bush - virtually all the growth since then has been wiped out.
Economic growth has essentially stopped. The whole world economy, outside of essential services like food production, healthcare, etc., has essentially stopped. All sorts of new business launches, new products, new services, stopped. Businesses have laid off billions of people worldwide, and people are living off savings or emergency government relief funds. Virtually no one is buying cars, houses, computers or much of anything beyond necessities like food. I’ve bought gas for my car twice in the last two months. Restaurants are essentially closed.
What you and I think doesn’t matter, it is only what those political masters think that matter because they are the ones with their fingers on the nuclear button which makes all of us go ‘BOOM’. And hands not just on the nuclear brief case, but the world’s most dangerous secret biowarfare laboratories creating Frankenstein viruses, which can threaten all humanity. As David Ellsworth said in one of the answers to this question: “It is sad to be living my final years on this earth with such a virulent plague, but I see that this may be a final evolutionary force to ensure the future unity of the world civilization.” Please read his answer. But there are people like Senator Marsha Blackburn, part of the political establishment who wish to lay the blame on other state actors without answering questions laid at their front door. The world will not be the same again. Now is not the time to blame but to work together, everyone is on board this ship.
Whether its a boom or not is very dependent on external factors as well, as our internal politics. Personally I'd be grateful to see a steady but strong increase in output and trade.
There are a lot of aspects to that question. The most obvious is that if you’re going to compare the statistics to when the country was mostly closed, yes, it’s going to look like a boom. But if you’re going to compare it to it’s highs, no, it’s not going to even make it to the same levels. The stock market will go up, many big corporations got money they really didn’t need and they’ll now have more of a cushion, their cash on hand increased and they didn’t need to do more with it. If they spent it on their laid off workers, the workers already had money and won’t make much of an impact when they go back, some of course already did work from home. For the largest amount of people though, they lost money, they’ll not be having a large amount of disposable income. Some might be afraid of spending the money they do have, fearing another spike in covid cases. I don’t see some massive spending campaign going on just because the lockdowns end. Money that’s not there isn’t going to magically appear, and the first of their income will go to rent, mortgage, taxes and utilities. Not new cars.
Second, there will be a withdrawal from globalism and the efficiencies it creates economically. Many economists believe that the Great Depression lasted as long as it did because of a withdrawal from globalism, and I don't see how we avoid a second run of that. There are problems with globalism, but it does create economic efficiency.
Apart from that, we have a new vision of economic growth. We’ve left behind a strategy of reduced regulation and reduced oversight, and have entered a political era where the more decisions we make from the top, the better. They will throw money at politically popular but economically unproductive projects, and those industries connected to their donors. They will raise energy costs. And they will impose top down rules an businesses nationwide in order to achieve politically preferrable outcomes.
It is certainly looking primed to do so. Not only were black employment numbers up in May, but the Dow Jones was over 27,500 yesterday, and the NASDAQ closed at 9,900 setting a new record on the tech heavy index, and bounced above 10,000 for the first time ever for a portion of today, closing up 29 points at 9,953.
My opinion: It will recover, not boom. People will remember, especially those who lost jobs and those that succumbed to the virus. They will watch their spending more closely. This is already happening in China. The Chinese government is reducing taxes to encourage spending, but it is not happening. The world will do the same. The question now is whether the recession will become a depression.
The recessions in a capitalist economy are caused by the generation of the so called Surplus value. What that means is that the system produces goods and services in excess of the purchasing power of the masses and the result is excess inventory of unsold goods and services. At some point the inventories become so large that production has to stop or slowdown. That leads to lower economic activity, lower output from both manufacturing and service sector. That in essence is what we call recession. Once the inventories are reduced the economic activity resumes to its normal level.
I think it’s going to take two things for our economy to really get going again: First, people are going to have to feel safe and that’s going to take some time. I don’t give a rat’s ass what any politician says, I’m not going to a football game nor am I allowing my kids to go to a concert until this thing is absolutely under control.
The world has completely changed, there will be no more growth for the sake of profits. If we are lucky, we will receive that which is necessary to sustain a normal, basic existence and no more.
Our economy depends largely on consumer demand. We save very little but we spend a great deal. When a consumer demands a product, the ripple effect goes through the store owner, wholesale supplier, manufacturer, raw goods suppliers and so on. Everyone gets paid along the way and they in turn demand groceries, other consumer goods, etc. All of these people are employed and earn income which they spend in part on consumer goods.
I think people will flock to restaurants, theme parks, night clubs bars, movie theaters as long they are open and safe to do so. People are exhausted of being told what to do and not able to do the things they enjoyed pre covid. Personally I can't wait for a safe trip to vegas and a concert.
Probably no, as the global delivery chains are broken. Tourism is far away from recovering and most restaurants, hotels, airlines, airplane manufacturers and car rentals will not survive. Automotive is in a big mess. Who is willing to buy a new car in the near future? That means that many suppliers of car manufacturers will commit bankruptcy. But without supply and without customers, car manufacturers cannot produce cars.
Most of Europe has been completely static since then. But not the US, interestingly enough. The US has a special economic position other countries lack. It controls the world markets through its massive military with 800 military bases overseas, as well its world reserve currency, allowing it to print money to pay for things almost infinitely as the demand for the currency always is far greater than its supply. The US can pay its way out of crisis that other countries can’t, and squeeze more resources out of other countries in a way other countries can’t.
First, Covid-19 isn’t just going to “blow over.” It is going to take a combination of vaccines and more effective treatments to bring it under control, and that is going to take time and effort. It is possible that by Q4 2021 the virus will be under control enough for the economy to begin the process of rebounding.
Under normal circumstances, there’s a bounce after a pandemic (think, “roaring twenties”), however this time the USA was already on its way to a major economic crash (think 1873) and Covid wasn’t even the trigger - there were already signs of major economic problems by December 2019, but Covid and the intransigence of the US Federal Government (along with many state governments) in dealing with it have guaranteed that things will be even worse than they could be.
For an economy to “boom”, consumers need money. And not just “some money”, but enough money to pay all the bills and have “disposable income” left over. And what enables consumers to have that kind of disposable income is a steady, profitable income stream… typically the kind of income generated by lots of good-paying jobs competing and paying top dollar for workers of all types.
The government is actively suppressing the free market, but its just muffling an ongoing boom. What, like people would just stop and give up?.
Some people are so afraid of catching the virus that they won’t drink alcohol from a glass that someone drunk from minutes before even knowing that it was been washed, other will refuse to go to hotel who look dirty. so on so on… people will be afraid.
Yes, populations are growing and therefore demand (for many products and services) will increase. It might, however, take a while (up to a couple of years) to stabilise and fully bounce back.
Economies tend to have recessions every 8–12 years or so. We’ve had I think 12 recessions since the Great Depression (feel free to fact check me on that). We were likely due for a recession between 2020 and 2022. I think it’s inherently good that this recession was self-induced rather than the result of a burst bubble. Why? As a result of the measures taken, I think going forward virtually every business is going to be looking to really protect themselves and make long-term plans. I think businesses are going to be looking to new ways to deliver their product or service. I think the cash injection into businesses now rather than a more crony version after a burst bubble type recession is better. And I think honestly it’s better for civil and social purposes that this recession is mostly seen as being nobody’s fault. In other words, if you had to pick a recession, you’d pick this one over a comparable one resulting from bad business practise. Because it’s self induced, the recovery basically begins as soon as the government ends lockdown. It isn’t like 2008 where it’s a more wait and see thing. When people are allowed back to work, the country can start being productive again is when the economy will start to pick up.
The US economy soared in the summer. In spite of his annoying personality, Trump was an economic solid performer.
I expect the US economy to slow down going forward for a couple of years. On the other hand I expect certain economics like India to pick very well going ahead, particularly after the second half of this year. I expect certain countries to face a major Earthquakes in the coming months which can set their economics back. Watch my prediction.
The economy is already improving. My retirement statement today showed over 8% growth in the last quarter. Unless regions are forced to shut down again, it should continue to improve.
In the past, companies in a nation would be closer economically to one another than to companies overseas. Today this is not the case. You can have two companies in the same neighbourhood that are in completely distinct supply chains and business network.
Yes but.., with likely changes. Changes in travel and lodging. Changes in business levels for theme parks, cruise lines and similar destinations. Lower airline use for an extended period. Eating out will remain off for an extended period too. Not forever though. The full recovery will depend on the full success of defeating the virus so it's no longer in the regular news cycle or a regular part of daily life. That's likely at least a year away and probably more like 18 to 24 months with our current actions and attitudes.
Economists used to scoff at calls for countries to pursue food or energy security policies. In a globalized world where borders don’t matter, they argued, we could always turn to other countries if something happened in our own. Now, borders suddenly do matter, as countries hold on tightly to face masks and medical equipment, and struggle to source supplies. The coronavirus crisis has been a powerful reminder that the basic political and economic unit is still the nation-state.
A large proportion of customers, in particular older customers or middle-aged customers in contact with elderly relatives, will be reluctant to engage in public activities such as restaurant eating, cafe chats and shows. Those people tend to be well off and consistent patrons of personal service type industries.
First thing, Covid-19 is not going to blow over. The pandemic will probably continue for several years, even though it will probably not continue at this level. We are currently in what can be described as a worldwide outbreak, in these months we have been trying (with more or less success) to curb the national outbreaks, but in the near future we will see more localized outbreaks, while the disease will slowly become endemic.
Oh, it will boom again eventually. However the Trump Administration was already busy propping up the house of cards the economy had become before the pandemic. He was desperate to keep the numbers up until election day. That isn't going to happen any more, and may not have happened anyway.
The economy WAS booming under President Trump. Under his term foreign countries were put on notice. Taxes (surcharges, fees, etc) were cut. Unemployment was at an all time low. My 401k went thru the roof. It would be booming NOW if not for the government imposed shut downs. Virus notwithstanding. All because morons out there that refuse to take simple precautions like wearing a mask (properly), using social distancing and sanitizing/washing hands! It's JUST THAT simple.
Invariably there will be a mini boom when society returns to normality and people spend a bunch of money on consumer items that they have been able or willing to go out and shop for during the Covid-19 lockdown. How big a jump that is, and how long that will last remains to be seen, and will depend partly on how long the lockdown remains in place.
That’s how the economy works. There are cycles… like waves on the ocean. They can’t swell forever. Sooner or later, there’s going to be a trough between the crests.
Nobody knows the future, so they guess. People who guess right make more money, because the economy makes money, and they get some of it. That actually helps the future arrive sooner, and it’s a pretty good thing.
Joshua Engel has explained stock market boom and bust cycles. That’s probably what the OP meant by “the economy” but the stock market and the economy are significantly different things. Sometimes stock markets can dip without affecting the general economy very much. Sometimes the economy can suffer while the market keeps rising.
The Government has a branch called the National Bureau of Economic Research. I have been a subscriber for about twenty years. Every day they send out a summary of the latest economic reports concerning the economy. Economic Indicators It’s a slog to get through all the data but it’s often worth it.
No, we are not in a recession. In order to qualify as a recession, we have to see two consecutive quarters (six months) of negative economic growth. The government measures the total amount of money spent within the United States every three months. That is everything - salaries, wages, consumer purchases, government paychecks, money that people put in the bank, loans, exports, etc. All of that is added up into one giant total known as the Gross Domestic Product.
Yep! The sad part is that we were nowhere near recession conditions when this outbreak occurred. But China is hurting first from the tariffs and now from this, Europe is getting hammered…especially Italy, not to mention whats happening here. Industries like the airlines, hotels, restaurants, even manufacturing and retail have largely been taken offline. There is a cloud of uncertainty over the entire country.
There is a big demand for widgets. All the manufacturers get the signal and start hiring like crazy and turning out more and more widgets, and then the market is satisfied, and soon there’s an over-supply of widgets (or houses or mortgages, or whatever), so they have to start dropping the price of widgets, and then they have to lay people off, and then people see people getting laid off so they stop buying stuff, and then more people get laid off, and so on…and everyone is sad and depressed for a while, and then people start to need widgets again, and we’re off.
The National Bureau of Economic Research declares when we enter and exit a recession. The economy has recurring cycles of expansion and contraction. We have NOT even begun to officially contract, but we will eventually, probably soon given current events. A rule of thumb is that a recession occurs when the economy contracts first at least 2 consecutive quarters (6 mos). But that is a rule of thumb and not the basis for officially declaring a recession.
Nobody can pinpoint a date but there are some solid indicators: yield curve, housing starts, consumer delinquency. These are the leading indicators that give a good snap shot of the future. If these show adverse signs then it’s timr to dig into other indicators like durable goods, marginally attached workers, etc.
The GDP growth rate of India go down to 5%, according to the data for the first quarter of 2019–20. Now The economy is flat. The Growth in the Agriculture Forestry and Fishing is 2%, Mining and Quarrying is 2.7%, Manufacturing is 0.6%, Construction and Financial and Real estate is 5.7% and Professional Services is 5.9%.No much research is required to find the reason.
Capitalism requires Capital to be a sound measure of wealth via prices, which are set by markets. Capital is measured in dollars or other currency, so currency must be sound for markets to work. Markets are an information system where prices are set by the aggregate activity of buyers and sellers in a *free and open* marketplace. This provides feedback on the real needs of an economy that top-down decision mechanisms cannot achieve. Being distributed, it is less subject to corruption so long as governance is strong (able to stop dishonest trade) and limited (limited to market activities, not selective, not corrupted), and the currency is sound (not able to be created arbitrarily, free to use and not controllable by entities with agendas).
Please also note that a slowdown in growth is still growth: GDP is getting bigger quarter after quater. If GDP stops growing and actually falls for two consecutive quarters, we call that “a recession,” not “a slowdown.”.
The economies, globally, are practically shut down, locked down, laid off to ward off the spread of the pandemic and fear of the virus and possible fatality is keeping labour or manpower off from all manufacturing or production activities and services. This has severely affected growth and development, which was hitherto possible, to serious downfall and into the negative meaning of growth and development. The serious contraction of business cycle in an economy on account of steadily declining economic activity is Recession. The Covid 19 virus issues are now faced in varying levels of difficulty in almost 189 nations globally. This is why the phenomena of Recession is well manifested in such nations and the whole world is experiencing it.
However, certain parts of the world's economy are somewhat stagnant and have been so since the 2008 financial crisis. This has been especially noticeable in places such as the United States and Europe. As newly developing countries have liberalized their economies and adopted a more positive role in the global economy, the privileged and entitled citizens of the incumbent elite have seen their advantage diminish. Poorer countries are gradually catching up with the richer ones.
People can cheat in under 10mins. It really has to do with having the opportunity to cheat. Unfortunately you can't control anyone. If you suspect your partner of cheating then dump them. If it goes against everything you stand for say goodbye. Sometimes it's best to be alone and lonely then to have to look over your partner's shoulder at everything he does. Why put yourself through so much stress and work trying to catch a cheater.
First of all are you happy with your relationship? I would assume you are not since your trying to play tricks on your partner. Let me ask you a question…. If you have to worry about your partner cheating is that partner really your partner? Do you think that they are? If you do then they probably are (unless you are on drugs and completely paranoid- I only say that because I have been, and I was wrong).
Matthew Edward Hall is highly influenced by the ‘60’s & ‘70’s but has a sound entirely unique to him. It sounds modern, futuristic, & classic at the same time somehow. I do believe he’s about to blow away the rest of the charts and contemporary artists. His writing is beyond Saintly, & overflowing with profound wisdom. He’s even younger than Harry Styles but carries a mind typically reserved for the greatest philosophers & Leaders of all time. It’s something you really have to listen to yourself, and a true test of will not listening to his songs 100’s of times. His newest release may be the greatest song ever recorded, and exclusively revealed to his Instagram followers. Thats one thing that really makes him special. I feel a true connection with him, and i’ve grown so much right along with him. It’s not like a normal listener experience. I’ve had profound personal revelations randomly come to me while listen to his music in the background, or after reading a quote or 2.
Bedroom/Indie Pop: Some artists include mxmtoon, khai dreams, mimi bay, girl in red, Clairo, tiffi, and Lana Del Rey. These are great, underrated artists that I love.
I like pretty much all kinds of music (except Gangster Rap. The lyrics are a problem more than the actual music)) Classical, Baroque, Medieval , Film Music , Musicals , Rock , Pop, Soul. Hip Hop, Trip Hop etc etc.
One of my favourite music pieces I would listen to while growing up were the classic kiwi songs. From people like Nesian Mystik, Adeaze, Aaradhna, who showed a lot of Polynesian representation in the New Zealand music industry, to SIX60, Stan Walker and Hollie Smith who showed a lot of Māori representation in the New Zealand music industry. There are also other artists like Lorde, BENEE and Drax Project who are absolutely killing it right now! Some recommendations are.
Though if I could take a guess, I would say punk rock/pop with a mix of late 90’s and early 2000’s hits.
There are probably other artists that I’m just completely forgetting. But mostly, my playlists consist of songs that I find either comforting, exciting, or anything along those lines. I just happen to like a lot of these artists songs.
Alternative rock: Weezer: which I started to listen to a ton during my middle school years and still listen to now as a senior in high school. Will always love them. Ozma: are very similar to Weezer in that they sing about love n’ stuff, and their first album is such a joy. The Strokes: but listen to pretty much their hits, which are pretty nice. Cage the Elephant: listen to the hits. Pavement: some of their hits. The Cure: my friend put me on them and I wasn’t disappointed, love listening to them. The Smiths: well, my friend also got me into them, great band. The Smoking Popes: love their hits!.
I was introduced to many genres of music, thanks to my parents. I grew up in a small village in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. That time, music was vary. There were Indonesian and Western pop, rock songs, and oldies. Also dangdut, campursari, keroncong, and Malaysian songs. They're pretty familiar to my ears. My parents said, when they brought me to a place for vacation, suddenly they hear me singing campursari song. I was four or something hahaha.
Not my favourite genre anymore and losing a little interest but they have a ton of addictive and catchy songs. I listen mainly to Twice and Gfriend but I also listen to Blackpink, (G)I-dle, IZ*ONE, BTS, Red Velvet, Mamamoo, Itzy, EXID, SNSD and EXO. Fyi, some of them have Japanese versions of their Kpop songs and even produced their own Japanese Pop songs! Here are some of my song recommendations.
Back when life used to be normal , I was studying in the reading room of my college . I looked around and noticed that most students are plugging away at their studying with their headphones on🎧. I wondered is it actually beneficial to listen to music while you study? In this answer I'll explain if studying with music is a good idea or not.
This question is the subject of a long debate without any end. It's like looking for the edge of a circle. Music triggers 'reward chemicals' in the brain. It means to reward oneself after a long working shift or completing that one project. But, can music go with studying?.
But I think its a personal choice after observing do you get more deviated while listening to songs or pay more attention to the subject than what you usually do. For me ,I think songs were the ones which helped me read NCERT again and again without getting bored like many others. (Also I loved memorising may be that too helped my cause).
However, there are some types of music that should not be used as background music while studying. Music with lyrics to distract you from reading books, writing down notes or speech letters can temporarily disrupt your concentration. High-volume music that is too loud can cause hearing problems when you study for a long time, so make sure this type of music is not too strong.
With a long study session ahead of you, your first instinct may be to whip out your headphones. However, recent psychological research suggests that we should think twice before tuning in to the first thing on our playlist. While research into the psychological effects of music is still in its infancy (and is often contradictory), here we're going to go over some generally accepted facts about music processing, and its effects on your cognitive performance.
Lo-Fi is definitely helpful. When I listen to songs with words, I have a tendency to write what I hear. Everyone does, pretty sure. I think it’s a neural thing. Anyway, listening to music without words really helps me focus on what I’m doing and to not get distracted.
If you're studying (not copying something), then no. It's not good for you as you won't be able to concentrate on what you're reading. On the other hand, if you're copying your work or practising something on a notebook, then yes, it's good.
Music has a powerful impact on our physiological states, emotions, and thought processes. If you’re a student, this is important to note. Music can truly be a lifesaver when it comes to getting through the emotional highs and lows, and the energy ebbs and flows that accompany educational pursuits.
If you’re a student, I am almost willing to bet that you have music playing right now. Maybe it’s Drake, maybe it’s Mumford and Sons, or maybe it’s The Beatles. Whatever your preference, I’m sure you love listening to your favorite artists every chance you get— maybe even while you study. Is playing your favorite song an easy way to make that homework bearable, or are you hurting your performance?.
Well not at all..... Songs may calm our mind (those with soft noft note) but while studying please avoid it. Listening to songs while studying will surely diatract you.. But yeah, I would suggest you to listen to instrumentals especially pianos,if there is disturbance around you. These notes will then cut those disturbing noises and providing you a calm environment. Spotify has a great playlist for this purpose named intense study.....
I will began my answer by telling everyone about ‘Mozart effect', a term coined from a study that suggested listening to music could actually enhance intelligence, has been widely refuted, there are still many benefits of listening to music while studying.
During the study, listening music is not beneficial but you can listen music in between study during your relax time or to refresh the mind for restarting your study again with peace and relaxed mind.
Research has found that if you listen to music while studying, you have a better chance of recalling that information if you listen to the same music during the exam. This, of course, is impossible.
For regular students , when they try to study , their focus is divided into many parts like .. their thoughts like should I check my WhatsApp or messenger ?, their surroundings, their emotions and what they see , hear etc i.e their mind is distracted.
The things that we experienced only once in our life and which we remember still are the things that we observed we very high focus and without distractions!.
When we study while listening to music .. our focus .. which was divided into many parts .. is now narrowed into two parts .. the music we are listening to and the textbook we are studying !.
But to my opinion on this matter! I say, it is a good thing! Why? Because it, for me allows me to concentrate more. The music you listen to is wanted, so not really a distraction. But, let's say Tommy from next door decided to cut his grass, play loud music (this is distracting you) and decided to sing at the top of his lungs, this would definitely put you off your study. Listening to music that you enjoy and you like it but not to much, it actually calms you down and makes you more relaxed. (No matter what genre) I know this from experience as I did this during my study period. Trust me, being relaxed during study is way better than being stressed and having many unwanted noise!.
According to research in neuropsychology and music psychology, music consistently elicit emotional responses in its listeners. Different people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music is affected by factors such as personality.
when you do so, you will not only confuse yourself also you will end up knowing nothing after you are done with studying . For short term … you may think that you have learnt and you can recall well , but as far as long term retention of topic which you have studied is considered… it don't help.. ultimately you have to go back and redo what you have already done before.
I cannot say for all, but in my personal opinion, based on my experience for a period around 2 years while I studied and I had radio in my room, it helped me. Frankly later on the radio was not available and then I was continuing my routine as if there was music and songs in the background!.
Yes of course ,music is good while studying,but only if it is productive for us.There should be consistency between music and study.
Music is not good while focussing on your books. This is because, half of your brain will concentrate on the music and other half on your books. In this way, you cannot give your 100% to your studies.
Yes, you read that right. We just know that it’s a spiral galaxy and we cannot send a probe far enough to capture the entire galaxy. All the images you have seen are just artistic works created by looking at other spiral galaxies. Below is a false image of our Milky way.
We’d all be dead if Earth was the largest planet in the solar system. But, since Jupiter has that distinction, most asteroids and comets crash into Jupiter. Jupiter is thus the dumping ground of the solar system. Thank Jupiter that you’re still alive.
Believe it or not, the Big Bang happened.Less than 1% of the noise that you see on the television/hear on your radio comes from the Big Bang.
To think that a god made all of that, to put people on one planet, out of billions upon billions of planets, who can only exist for tiny periods of time and impact nothing beyond their small planet can only mean that god is not very smart, efficient or decisive.
The universe is not proven to have a finite past. Cosmology and physics tell us that 13.7 billion years ago, all space, matter, energy, and time was in a state of compression into a single point of singularity. This does not mean that there was nothing "before" that.
Renowned Oxford University mathematical physicist Roger Penrose published a paper in which he calculated the probabilities of the Universe accidently coming into creation without a deliberate architect. Penrose’s calculations resulted in the compelling conclusion that the creator of the Universe had an accuracy in all things required to the extent of 1 part in 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 123, that is 1 followed by 10 to the 123rd power. An accuracy and precision which is unthinkable. Otherwise, there would have been nothing. Oxford University Professor of Mathematics John Lennox double checked Penrose’s numbers and observed, that Penrose’s resulting accuracy number is a “number which it would be impossible to write out in the usual decimal way, because even if you were able to put a zero on every particle in the universe, there would not even be enough particles to do the job.” That is the degree of accuracy that was demonstrated when the Universe was created. Basically, this is a scientific way to say that the Universe was not created by chance. If it was not created by chance, then it was created deliberately. If we can conclude that it was created deliberately, then we must conclude that there was a creator. I could stop writing right here. But I will not.
Where scientists run into trouble is when they attempt to explain what existed prior to the Big Bang. It is believed that in order for there to be a big bang the matter that exploded was smaller than an atom. But who created that matter? Reason demands that there was an origin to the components that made up the pre-big bang existence. Logic always points back to a pre-creation creator. Nothing less than God can exist without an origin. Without a beginning. The famed Stephen Hawking is quoted as saying "There is nothing south of the South Pole, so there was nothing around before the Big Bang." He actually dismisses the issue as opposed to being open to the possibility of God.
The universe had a beginning. It will likely have an ending. We agree on that. I'm open to any evidence that a god, gods, goddesses, inter-dimensional robots, brane convergences, fluffy invisible pink unicorns, or something else did it. I await your evidence as long as it doesn't involve "special pleading", tautology or untestable claims.
I take more of a Buddhist view than an atheistic/materialistic view. I think of consciousness as a first-class citizen, and the physical world as an appearance to the mind, that would be meaningless without minds in it. (Are there other universes? If there are conscious beings in them, they exist. Without conscious beings in them, the question is vacuous.) I think it's much more likely than not that there are aspects of consciousness (qualia) on which our material calculus will always fall short. However, I don't claim that there is obvious or objective evidence for anything supernatural (there is not) and even if there were, we'd still be far from having any cause to conclude the existence of any specific type of God.
Some of us believe that life has a spiritual dimension which allows communication directly with the same God who created the universe. But that is a leap of faith. You either leap or you don't leap. Don't even try to use logic to make other people leap with you. Instead demonstrate your faith by the way you live. By your "fruits" people will know who you really are, and may take an interest in why you are the way your are, which will give you an opportunity to talk about the God you believe in. By faith.
It's not clear at all, even for people who believe in Gods. Most religions of the past didn't feature one-man, creator gods. Creating the universe just wasn't part of the job description. That profile didn't come along til Yaweh, and there's plenty of evidence in the Old Testament that he wasn't the only god on the job. In some places he seems to be sitting on a godly board of directors meeting of some sort. In some parts of the original Hebrew scriptures he's called Yaweh, in others, El. They're not the same deity El is a Phonecian god. What's up with that?.
That kind of answer has absolutely no appeal to me at all. My curiosity and thirst for knowledge is fairly insatiable. I'm always on the look out for new discoveries, whether it's new pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope, results from the Large Hadron Collider, or fossils that are dug up. I want to know what new evidence has been discovered in all the fields of science, and how that new evidence reveals more about the way our universe functions and the tools we have to function inside of the cosmos.
If he/she did say that, they are as much of a scientist, as cotton candy is anchovies. The majority would probably tell you 200k, maybe even more.
This gives you an out, because you don't have to say what the qualities of this thing are. And as it turns out, if you look at the multitudes of claims about what this string of letters signifies, you'll find there's not a single quality that can be found in all of them.
According to this theory, the whole universe was condensed in small particle and due to huge energy it exploded so devastatingly that created a big bang, don't quote me on this because I'm not a science guy and I am not sure about technicalities of this aspect. I am just presenting layman terminology of the big bang.
My counter to this would be that you (and I) are clearly incapable of understanding the universe precisely because of how far beyond basic logic its rules have proven to be, so you trying to use basic logic to get us down to "the only option" is doomed from the start. You're an ant trying to understand a spaceship, so how likely is it that you can encapsulate the answer into one word and have that word be meaningful?.
Also using English language and word games to figure out God or the universe doesn't make sense to me. The English language is designed for everyday experience, and it works very badly when even trying to figure out how a ball rolls down a hill much less looking at the universe.
By following the evidence we know how things formed after a certain point in time. We know that there was a rapid expansion of space time, and we know how the first elements and their components began forming. What we do not know yet is how everything started.
It is written, “Although they know God exists, they neither glorify Him as God nor do they give thanks to Him. Their thinking, futile, their foolish hearts, darkened. Claiming to be wise, but have become fools.
Let's make this pointlessly complicated: The universe is NOT proven to have a finite past, whatever that means. Events do NOT require causes. Deductive reasoning is NOT a comprehensive or infallible means of acquiring understanding. Any concept of god is NOT exempt from same question of "where did it come from?". Any attempt to ascribe a mysterious or as yet not understood phenomena to god is NOT an intellectually valid move.
Prob is, you're using circular reasoning. You're saying there had to be a cause, therefore it had to be this "God" thing. Fine, if you accept the dubious idea that there had to be a cause. Things in our world generally have causes, but it's a bit of a stretch to extend what happens here and now to what happened far away 13.7 billion years ago.
If you want to be taken up seriously you should beef up your argument with a few pieces of real evidence, not misinterpretations of evidence, real evidence that supports your theory and your theory alone. Well, perhaps I'm too harsh here. Some pieces of evidence could perhaps support multiple theories, but you need to be able to show why they support your argument as opposed to a more simplistic and elegant alternative.
A is not proven to be false. Big Bang is only "proven" to the first millionths millionths after the supposed "bang", but not before (since the laws of physics break down at such high energies). If the Big Bang really did happen the way it is commonly portrayed in popular science then all that it shows is that the universe we currently live in was created 13 and a half billion years ago. Some theories, such as eternal inflation actually imply that there may be infinitely many universes created in the same fashion. Other theories, such as the string theory don't even entertain the idea of singularity, whereas the holographic principle implies that our universe was created from a 4-d black hole. The point of it all is that despite all the great advances in science there are still many questions remaining to be answered.
There is no evidence of any god having created it. No god is necessary to explain anything that has been observed. And no god could explain the origin of the universe, because we would still be lacking an explanation for where that god came from.
When I came home a few Fridays ago, there was a bouquet of flowers on my table. I had no idea why they were there or who could possibly have put them there. So it must have been God! Turned out Friday was Valentine's Day, and the next day my wife was really ticked I didn't thank her because I thought it was God. Since then I have learned that if I don't know why something is there, it doesn't mean God must have put it there. Why do you creationists all make this argument? Just because you're too unimaginative to think of a cause other than "God" does not mean it was caused God. That is just not a logically sensible step to take anymore for the universe's existence than it is for why there's flowers on my table.
There are a ton of unanswered questions, especially when it comes to creation and the creation of life. For example, what was the precursor for RNA? TNA? What about before that? How do we know for sure? we don't. Some argue that Hydrogen and Helium existed before the big bang and others disagree. People still make determinations about dark matter when there's still a lot that we don't understand. There are a lot of mysteries to be solved and plenty to choose from and how a person wants to handle answering such a mystery is up to them.
This question is akin to a common question thrown around in entrepreneur circles how do you start a successful start-up. There is no one definitive answer or formula that works but instead there are a bunch of rules you can follow that would increase your odds. After that, you can only hope that the dice rolls in your favor. Rarely have I met a person and been convinced that there is no way on earth this person is not getting into College X. In fact the only person that comes to my mind is my friend Raghu Mahajan who among other things topped JEE a few years ago. And in case you are updating your model that topping JEE implies getting into one of these colleges, don't do so. Topping JEE was just a byproduct of being Raghu. The man exudes mastery of the sciences like no other. JEE was just a validation of this fact and not really an achievement per se. Yet Raghu is an outlier. He is like Bill Gates in that sense. Those who knew Bill Gates in the 70's had never any doubt that he would start one of the most successful companies in the world. Most of us need the dice to roll in our favor.
I wouldn't consider myself an authority by any means, but I got into an Ivy League university even though I'm not a straight A student or a superhuman who's internationally ranked in mathematics.
Other proofs that  1=2  often use the same method but hide the division by zero in the algebra. In your example, it was when you divided by  (x−x) . My proof (unlike yours) is too blatantly obvious to make it into a good paradox, but its transparency is what makes it helpful to those who are mystified by the rule that you are not allowed to divide by zero, even in the form  (x−x.
Mathematics is a game. It has rules. Astonishingly few rules, given the richness of possible outcomes of the game. But the rules it has are inviolate.
When you divide by (x-x) you are doing an illegal Mathematical operation.
I think one of the simplest explanations involves the fact that division is not an operation of and by itself. Division is the inverse of the operation of multiplication—the “dark side,” if you will. What we mean by inverse is that division is just a backwards multiplication question.
As a typical LW maniac, my first response to stuff like this is, substitute a concrete number for  x . Algebra is all about rules that preserve the truth of equations, so if we start with any concrete true example of the first equation, we should be able to follow your logic and see what happens.
(x−x)  is zero. Which means that you’re effectively dividing both sides by zero, which is algebraically disallowed.
This is in a class of trick proofs where there is a division by zero somewhere. Your “Divide both sides by (x –x)” step, in this case. When you divide by zero, you typically get the entire real number line, which is equal to the entire real number line as well as equal to twice the entire real number line, so x = 2x is true when x is, well, everything.
It is very easy to prove 1 = 2, but we all know it is wrong. But, most of us don’t know how to prove it wrong. I will tell you both how to prove it (1 = 2) and how to prove it wrong.
In mathematics, division by zero is division where the divisor (denominator) is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as a/0 where a is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, multiplied by 0, gives a (assuming a≠0), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 also has no defined value, when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to a/0 is contained in George Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in The Analyst ("ghosts of departed quantities").
The problem comes when you divide both sides by (x-x). It seems legitimate, because it’s a variable expression — but if you think about it, (x-x) is zero, so when you take this step, you are essentially tricked into accepting division by zero.
Everyone knows that dividing by actual zero is impossible in arithmetic, and is illegal in algebra because it yields invalid results. In this exercise, the author temporarily forgets that x - x could be 0, goes ahead and divides by x - x, and then wonders why he “proved” a false statement.
Now all you have to do is put one of these on the left side of the equation and another one at the right side. You might want to add some equations to “hide” the zero division, like the first part of the proof in your question.
You never "eliminate" anything because it's on both side. You divide both sides of an equation by the common factor. The problem here is that your common factor is zero and division by zero doesn't make sense.
Give yourself a pat on the back if you noticed that (x-x) has been factorized and divided from both sides. See anything wrong there? Well, elementarily - this step is invalid, considering that (x-x) = 0, and by the laws of algebra and mathematics, dividing anything by zero gives you an invalid output. This hoax ‘proof’ is quite old and popular, but ensures that you’re well acquainted with your fundamentals. So, are you.
If you give that calculation to a technical student (math, physics, engineering) then they will do the multiplies first and then the additions and subtractions. So the answer they will give you is 6 - (1 x 0) + (2/2) = 7.
We all try to use simple expressions if we can. I try never to use an actual symbol for multiplication, just juxtaposition. Division may have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction, but when we write the numerator above the denominator separated by a line (called a vinculum), it has a lower precedence, as in.
When I was younger I used to define success as being able to figure out how to fit a round peg in a square hole. (Now my wife and I define success as getting the kids to sleep early enough that we actually have a couple hours to ourselves before going to bed).
Sounds pretty simple... there couldn't be that many different ways, right? Let's give the people names: Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave. So you could give Alice 8 apples, or you could give her 7 apples and give someone else 1 apple, or you could give Alice 6 apples and then... OK, maybe this is more complicated than we thought.
When I was in middle school, I read the wonderful little book Flatland by Edwin A. Abbott. The story is narrated by a square in a two-dimensional world who encounters a sphere from the third dimension. At first, the square cannot conceive of a world with higher dimensions, until the sphere uses simple mathematical reasoning to help the square imagine a cube. For the sake of clarity, I will retell the story from the point of view of someone trying to explain what a four-dimensional cube looks like to us.
If you tie a rope around the Earth tightly (lets say around the equator) ,then the length of the rope will be around 40,000 km. Now just add 1 meter of rope to that rope and if the extra rope is distributed evenly around the globe, will there be enough space between the rope and the earth's surface for a rat to pass under or even a worm to crawl under???.
I was in 8th grade back then when my professor was teaching a chapter called mensuration. We were solving a sum on area of a circle. I asked my professor how did mathematicians find this darn formula. He said they found that the area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of the radius. They found this by plotting circles and counting the number squares in it. This baffled me so I pressed harder for a better explanation. So tired of my questions he said " Boy you do not know calculus. They found by using calculus which you will study in your higher classes..
I have realized that mathematics is beautiful more than once. But since you ask for the first little bit of mathematics that made me realize when mathematics is beautiful, I have to describe a quite unremarkable story from my childhood days when I was 6 and learning multiplication tables at school.
Here is how it started for me. I was probably in fourth grade when my elder brother who was four years elder than me told me how his maths teacher had taught him to measure the height if a building and a tree using a thread, ruler and a protractor. I was really amazed. Later my father told me that there is something called trigonometry that we can use to measure large distances, even of that sun or moon using simple gadgets like telescopes, rulers and sextants(device for measuring angle). This really fascinated me (the involvement of other planets in the discussion somehow made it more interesting). However, I found it pretty unbelievable. Few years later when I stumbled onto trigonometry as my coursework, this was my most favorite topic. I immediately completed the chapters and went about to make my own sextant and telescope to practice my favorite problem.
Irrational numbers: The concept of rational and irrational number (non recurring non-terminating numbers) intrigued me. I wondered how a number could exist that could not be expressed in the form of p/q (fractions). But more shocking part came when I learned even though you can't express it in form of p/q you could represent it on a number line. You can't write it (1.4142135....) but you can draw it.
One day, they were talking about a program to find a perfect number, a number which is the sum of its factors including 1 but excluding itself. I was fascinated by the property and also as a medium to give a reply to my mocking, I set out to find the formula for perfect numbers.
In primary school, Gauss' teacher instructed the class to add up the numbers from 1 to 100 on slate as busywork. While the rest of the class toiled, Gauss thought about the problem for a moment, wrote down the number 5050, and turned it in. His answer was the only correct answer.
It took me a while to realize that what mathematicians mean by "beauty" is what I had been calling "awesomeness". It happened when was a third-year university student taking abstract algebra.
For me, it was Euclid's proof of the infinitude of prime numbers. Back when I was a kid, it seemed amazing to me that you could prove that there isn't a largest prime. I remember being awestruck and ecstatic. Ever since, I've taken a liking to math.
Consider  n  trees in a row, equally spaced. Initially, one bird sits on each tree, and each minute two birds are allowed to fly to another tree in such a way that they move the same distance in opposite directions. For which n can all of the birds end up on the same tree?.
I was simply adding and calculating random numbers on an empty piece of paper, nothing like John Nash though, I must add. And then, suddenly, with one simple calculation, I unravelled something extremely beautiful, something that made me see how wonderful mathematics was. I took this number.
Euler's V - E + F = 2 still amazes me. All those crazy polyhedra, big and small, spiky and regular, all fit into one big schema.
There was the usual combinatorics solution , but this one is what caught my eye, 1 match = 1 eliminated, so to decide the winner we need n-1 matches.Elegant and simple answers make maths beautiful don't they.
If you place a map of a city on a table in that city, there will always be a "You are here" point on the map which exactly represents that same point in the city.
I was never that great at math. Perhaps in elementary school I'd get receive the odd 'A' here and there, but I was mostly in the 'C'-area if anything. Moving on to high school, things didn't get any better. My marks for grade 9, 10, and 11 were 51, 40, and 56 respectively. (The 40 meant I failed and needed to attend summer school where I got a 60-something and was able to move on). My 10th grade teacher told me that math was an "either you get it or you don't" subject. My 11th grade teacher told me he had tried everything, and when I pleaded with him that I still didn't understand anything, he repeated himself more firmly, "I have tried everything I can to help you", and walked away.
If you can't prove something's correct, you have a gap in your knowledge, and should not rest until it's filled. I recommend asking your teacher why the statement is true (and applying the same adversarial mindset to their explanation). In some cases, the teacher may be wrong, in which case it's good to alert them of the error.
Visualize every concept. The best mathematicians in history all claimed to have a visual mind that allowed them to 'see' the math they were working with. Einstein did so and the great Alon Amit on Quora practices this a lot.
Math education is one of the saddest things I know, and it’s because most mathematicians don’t give a crap about education and it really shows. This means most dedicated teachers are probably not well versed in the subject, and those that are are likely too busy in their self absorbed work to be bothered by anyone else.
Suppose there's a topic you just don't get. Adding fractions, say. You can practice hundreds of exercises, and at the end of it all you might not see any improvement. But that one breakthrough is always right around the corner. You might have to look for it a little bit, but as soon as you get it, it clicks. You can go from absolute confusion to perfect understanding in a matter of minutes. When you think about it, this is weird.
It's as though they're trying to learn musical composition by memorising templates and rules. Sure you'll be able to churn out boiler-plate stuff - elevator music, advertising jingles, formulaic pop songs. Or it's like someone trying to become a great athlete by memorising the moves they need, without understanding the sport as a sport - that is, as something you would do for pleasure, for the joy of exercising a skill.
Remember the 1st time you tried a new sport? Say baseball for example...you probably didn't even know how to hold the bat! Once you learned that you progressed to how to stand, how to keep your eye on the ball, how and when to swing BUT if you are still not even gripping the bat correctly, you're lost and would probably HATE the game!! But once your skills are good, you LOVE the game.
I'm not too familiar with how deeply the topics are explored in your/typical US high school classes, and how much you are encouraged by your teachers to think beyond getting some correct exam answers, but nonetheless, I believe that there is still a lot you can improve by yourself, although having support does boost up the process tremendously.
If you see math as the manipulation of numbers only then you’ll never be great at it. When you solve a complex problem, you should be thinking about things like how to diagram the problem in your head and how to represent it in the simplest and easiest way possible. One thing to keep in mind is that people who truly have a knack for math have a certain, special kind of laziness to their nature, and they will sometimes work on a problem for hours that they’ve already found a way to solve, just so they can understand it well enough to find the laziest possible way to do the problem. You’ll see these guys at math competitions doing really hard problems in their head, and it’s not because they’re smarter than everyone in the audience, but rather because they know how to solve these problems with the least mental effort possible, and because they reached that knowledge by attaining a deep understanding of a variety of problems. When someone good at math looks at a problem, the first thing they do is create a representation of that problem in in their head, usually a visual one, and then they see if it fits a model of problems they’ve already done. If it does he’ll solve it the easiest way he knows how, avoiding te use of a calculator if possible (because on many simpler problems, calculators can actually be slower if you count the time it takes to press all the keys and also can make error more likely. Of course if it takes more than about ten seconds to do in his head he will of course use a calculator because he is, as aforementioned, lazy). If he hasn’t seen a problem of this nature before, he will separate it into smaller and smaller chunks, and try to solve each of those chunks. If there is then a chunk that e doesn’t recognize or know how to solve, he will then play with it the way that a kid plays with play-dough, wrapping his mind around it in different ways and changing its shape, because as babies know instinctively, playing with something unfamiliar is the best way to learn about it. Eventually, after enough playing, he will understand the chunk well enough to plug it back into the larger whole and thensolve the problem.

If you are in high school, try your best to understand it, but focus on your exams when they are near. If you can't understand it, ask your teachers, colleagues, that “Sharma ji ka ladka or ladki” in your class, etc. You may even find a girlfriend or boyfriend via maths. Seems unbelievable, but hey it is possible. Try to relate mathematical problems with real life scenarios.
I think the most important thing is to always ask "why?". If you're just memorizing formulas and trying to pass tests math can seem like a bunch of difficult, arbitrary rules. If you ask where the rules come from and why the rules work, then you'll begin to see deeper picture and think like a real mathematician.
This is a big problem for lots of people. It even is seen by some researchers as a frontal lobe issue. They say if you think you're bad at math, your frontal lobe shuts off and you won't get it. You have to convince yourself that you can do it and that lobe-thing will accept the task and you're on your way. Who knows?.
When I was a sophomore, I engaged a math tutor, who was a math PhD student at Harvard at the time. I confessed to him that I thought of myself as a math idiot, and he told me he’ll make that assessment for himself. After a few weeks he was pretty puzzled by the fact that I could understand all the things that he had explained to me. I was too.
Let me illustrate this with an example from my life. I went to school in India and, in 10th grade, I had to pass a board examination. As you would think, a board examination is administered by some authority outside the school itself. A student who does not pass the board exam cannot go onto 11th grade. He will be detained in 10th grade. So, it is a do or die situation from the perspective of a 16 year old. In that board examination, I did alright in all subjects except mathematics. The passing mark was 35 (yes, 35/100) and I got 46. So, I passed but barely.
Try to understand the basic concept of a given topic and build upon it do a practice problem and if you made mistakes it is okay it is a stage of learning try to understand why you made those mistakes then deeply understand the ideas correct them and form a solid ground for those concepts, after that apply them to real life situations you can also create your own way of solving questions just for fun :).
Also, you may need to sort out your priorities first. What exactly do you mean by being great at math? Are you looking to score a lot on tests? If so, practice hard. Are you trying to develop a better understanding of the very nature of mathematical analysis and problem solving? If so, work smart. Read the principle involved instead of blindly following shortcuts and quick fixes.
You see there is a reason for a person to be bright. It's the concentration and the qualities that come along with it, that gives that ability. It's a mental thing, mental development. Along with that development comes, being good at : learning things, memorizing them, recalling them fast, analyzing the combinations and patterns, logic, + reduction in stress / anxiety with the loading of studies, which puts a perfect skill platform for studying.
Most will say practice. I’ll do you one better. It’s important to know how to do something in math. But it’s more important to know WHY we do that. If you can understand why methods are used, you’ll grasp them a lot easier and you may even create math shortcuts for yourself because of it. Building off this, it’s important to know each part like the back of your hand. This comes from having a good foundation to work from through every level. This foundation is gained from my first point as well as repetition. If something confuses you or you have no idea why you need to do a specific step then stop there and ask someone because if you don’t learn, that you won’t have a good foundation for the next level. Math is only hard, when you don’t ask questions. A good teacher always helps. Someone who’s willing to answer your questions. So the answer is foundation, understanding, and repetition.
Keep solving problems. Just keep solving them. Improve mental math. Remember, we came across basic operations of addition subtraction multiplication division first. Calculus came way later. Binomial wasn't even a word we knew when we started counting. Improve mental math and keep solving problems. It could be the same problem or similar problems of lowet complexity. Or maybe even a solved and illustrated problem. And read a lot about the topic in hand. Not big theory, small compact stuff which sounds interesting.
The trick is to always go back to the basics. Even if you are 5 weeks into the subject, never feel as though you need to "keep up" with the class. The moment I felt lost, I would switch off and simply go back to where I feel comfortable (even if it means going back to week 1 and building up from there).
One of the biggest myths regarding math is that you are either born with the ability or not. This is far from the truth. There are incredibly gifted people in the world, but just because you are not one of these people does not mean you cannot find success.
There’s a difference between arithmetic and math. The most difficult section in any algebra book is the word problem section. A physics book is nothing but word problems from cover to cover. Something to think about is that these physics word problems call on skills one can learn in the word problem section of any algebra book.
The key to succeeding in Mathematics is not to study Mathematics, but constantly working on mathematical problem solving.
That's all I will recommend. And take help from different reference books, your teachers , friends or parents. Also don't just study from 1 book include more books in the circle.
Try to understand what you’re doing every time you’re doing maths. In this way, your brain will not try to memorize the process you’re using but will incorporate the basic ideas with the things you already know.
Actually you can become good at anything through repeated practice.There are two types of talents in the world.One is inborn and the other one is acquired.If you do hardwork you will acquire mastery in maths.
A mathematician was being interviewed for a job. The interviewer asks him - "You are walking towards your office and running late for a very important meeting and you glimpse a building on fire with people screaming for help. What will you do?".
The mathematician thinks for a while and replies : "People's lives are more important than an office meeting. I would immediately call for a fire brigade and help the trapped to the best of my abilities". The interviewer seems to be impressed with the mathematician's answer and moves on to the last question. Just to check his sanity, she asks: "And what if the building is not on fire?".
An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician take part in a study. The three of them are each sent into three separate rooms with white walls, given a bucket of green paint, and asked to paint all the walls green. However, there is not enough paint in each bucket to accomplish this task.
Yes, you read it correctly. Being a student, pursuing Mathematics as the Hons. subject, it is needless to state that, for me Mathematics is the other name of love and I am pretty much sure that you will certainly be in a relationship with mathematics if you find its true beauty. Let's have the trailer….
In this portion, we will define Blood Relations of Ramayana in light of Matrix Multiplication and with help of this, we will show that “Matrix Multiplication is not commutative..
I’m a top student. This is just a full on brag, but because no one believes you until you give numbers, here are some of my stats: 4.0 GPA, 5s on APs, 35 ACT, all while doing extracurriculars like a job, competitions, etc all and still sleeping 8 hours a day.
I qualified some of the toughest exams of India : JEE Advance, UPSC Prelims etc in first attempt. don’t know whether I qualify as “top student” to answer this question or not but here are my tricks.
The best brain I've ever come across. Also my roomie and I'm extremely lucky to have him.I don't know about other students who study day and night and then get decent or more than Average marks in the examination. I will tell you about a person who studies just for 3 days in the whole semester and still one of the topper of IISc Bangalore.He has the ability to sleep 16 hours a day and he does it with complete perfection.Whatever the situation is, all he does is…..Sleep.
‘I value my own child’s education greatly and I respect that he has a motivated friend like you.’ my dad solemnly expressed, taking a breath and continued ‘Study with and coach Peng Peng every day and I do not intend to charge you a single dime of rent.’.
They listen with an open mind. People think they just have a few days to cover the syllabus. What’s the entire year for, then? We get months to learn and prepare. Top students pay attention in class as one never knows what might click during the paper.
Teach it first: To understand new systems / concepts, stand up in front of a chalkboard and act as if you're teaching it to a class. When you get to a point you don't know how to explain, talk it out. Literally, stand up and talk to yourself, it works.
When I was in hostel one of my friend who always scored good marks and was the topper of our campus always carried a water bottle in class and whenever she felt loss in concentration she used to take a sip of water.
Always go to class. Even if the lectures are not useful, they serve to structure my day. Having lots of free time creates diminishing returns for me - three hours isn't too different from four hours, but having one block of three hours and one block of one hour is significantly better.
Doing that kept fetching me good scores. I scored 90% in 10th standard (CBSE Board) and 90.2% in 12th standard (CBSE Board). And yes, I didn't care about perfection, I chose to study in a way that wouldn't make it appear as a burden to me. I enjoyed whatever I studied and I'm grateful for working in a way that I had.
I made these colourful and attractive so I wouldn't get bored, and used wording I'd find easier for me to learn. This motivated me during exam season to study, for two reasons.
There is no particular strategy. Everybody has a different style tbh. But the common aspect is that they are consistent and maintain discipline throughout the journey. They just want results so they just work accordingly.
Now, this guy, is what you call a wonder kid. He’s not your typical nerd who spends all day with his books without a social life. On the contrary, he’s pretty famous in college. Not for his marks, but because he is the sports superstar of the campus. He’s the volleyball captain of IIM Bangalore who played a major role in winning the inter IIM sports tournament at IIM Ahmedabad.
I am a student. I am currently in 11th standard and I am going to tell you my personal experience on how do topper students study. I have completed my 13 years of schooling ( Nursery - X) from an ICSE affiliated school in sambalpur, odisha. Since the beginning, I was a good students as my teachers said. I was always in the top 5 ranks of the class and I passed my class Xth with 90% marks.
In today’s world, we are constantly bombarded by notification, mails, calls and chats. It is proved by studies that even one minute of distraction has a cascading negative effect on our productivity.
The exam involves a rigorous two-year preparation of Physics, Chemistry, and Maths subjects. However, through the techniques which 16-year old me had devised, I could crack it in meagre four months of preparation.
Who attend every class, write down all the important notes. They complete their assignments on time and all by themselves. They practice questions regularly. Even after these things they give proper time to sports and other cultural events.
I had a topper in my class. He was just like us who hated to study. But was always 1st in class. The thing he did was pay his 100% attention in class. So he would only need to study once or twice during exams. This is really helpful. The other thing is understand, write and practice. There are no other methods to study which can make you a topper. You just need to study in a systematic way. The topper in my class did not study everyday. But as he understood everything that was taught, he had to study less during exams.
Start reading very slowly, as slowly as you can, so that you understand each and every word in just one reading. Don't try to remember anything, just understand.
Yes. Whatever exam's you are preparing for, just make sure your everyday routine follows revision schedule because everytime your Brain feeds same facts & concepts, it absorbs it perfectly!.
I was a decent student back when I was an MIT undergrad and now that I'm a prof, and I really want my students to do well. Every semester, I email them a link to the following article by Cal Newport: http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/10/03/the-art-of-stealth-studying-how-to-earn-a-40-with-only-10-hours-of-work/, which pretty much summarizes everything in about a thousand words.
I dunno if I'm a top student. But I have scored 97% (10th), 97.58% (12th), 96.2% (UG) and have cracked GATE-19 and CAT-19 exam, and have been with some top students during my school and college days. So I'll pen down my thoughts on how 'top' students study.
Ever find yourself up late at night expending more energy trying to keep your eyelids open than you are studying? If so, it's time for a change. Successful students typically space their work out over shorter periods of time and rarely try to cram all of their studying into just one or two sessions. If you want to become a successful student then you need to learn to be consistent in your studies and to have regular, yet shorter, study periods.
Of course not. Why should we? What the hell would we gain from knowing about an absurd list? I bet there are very rare people in this world who follow the most successful people's career advice. But right now, what I am gonna tell you, would not only help you focus in studies, but in shaping your future too in the long run. And yeah, this list will definitely help you prepare for studies mentally, as well as psychologically.
Make a timetable. Whether it's a long term timetable or a short one, it is useful. For JEE I used to have a timetable for every month, what I'd be studying each day. It really helps to keep track of time. Otherwise you keep thinking “ abhi toh time hai “ (I have plenty of time right now) but in the end you realise that time flies faster than you think.
Almost every Top Notch performer I have worked with has a very clear cut goal stated IN WRITING. They have this goal pasted on top of their study table, in the toilet, on a notice board in the house, and some of them even have a piece of paper in their pocket. That is the kind of obsession they have with their goal.
Success is never a destination but its a journey that we all sail through, make priorities, create short term and long term goals, to face success humbly and to face failure with patience.
Once I was working late in the office to complete the month’s target. By the time I was leaving for home it was almost 9 pm. I completed my work and emailed the same to my immediate boss. He gave me a call and asked me to wait. He said he will drop me home. Since it was getting late, I did not mind taking his help. My boss and I got into his XUV and headed home from office. I used to stay alone in my flat. During the travel he started praising me for my hard work and dedication towards work. I was very flattered. By the time I reached my building he said he forgot his bottle of water and wanted me to fetch him some water. I asked him to come to my flat so that he can drink water . I opened the door and asked him to get in. I hurried to the kitchen to get him a bottle of ice cold water. He followed me too and grabbed me from behind. He dropped my sari pallu and went down on his knees and kissed my navel. I felt excited. He pushed me to the wall and poked my navel with his finger and I was moaning. he continued this for a long time and till then he had opened my sari. I was shocked and I was feeling ashamed. I quickly pulled my sari and rushed to the bedroom and closed the door.
This happened last year. I was 22.It was Holi. One of my friends lives in an apartment complex so there are lots of people who play holi together, which is why I and a couple of other friends had gone there to celebrate. I was wearing a white kurta and jeans…as usual most of people wears.
Yes, my mom! She has touched my navel several times when she helps me drape my saree. They are just accidental touches, and there is nothing wrong with it. But, once for a reception ceremony, my brother got the opportunity to see my navel. And the circumstances that led to it were one of the embarrassing moments in my life. I'm still nervous to talk about the whole incident as people might find it inappropriate. However, as I have the option to go anonymous in Quaro, I'm finally sharing it just to feel a little better.
Be Focused. When you decide and settle down to start studying, the first thing you need to do is get rid of useless thoughts Your friends may be on a holiday trip or they might be playing outside during your study time, these thoughts might keep pestering you but never let it hamper your focus. It's your career and you shouldn't let others come in your way of making it bright.
The idea of a "study schedule" is a myth. It's fine to study in chunks, or in sessions throughout the day, or for a few minutes at a time. The point is that you need regular periods when you're focused on studying with complete attention for 20-30 minutes at a time. Most people don't understand how intense repeated bursts of focus can be - it's truly intense and actually exhausting even if it doesn't feel that way while you're doing it.
I can tell you about a peculiar studying habit of a friend of mine - the topper of my department during exams, while I was pursuing Bachelors at IIT Kharagpur. So in a particular semester, we had five theoretical subjects (say A, B, C, D, E) and E’s mid-semester exam was scheduled to be at last among all the five subjects.
Everyone has an unique path to success but there are some traits which are common among toppers. The toppers usually live in an ecosystem(created by themselves) and study is one part of it,so i will try to point out all these things along-with study habits in following points.
Methods: In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥27 in persons with ≥1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.
It’s never easy to find the right weight loss medication, but when it comes to products, a lot of time is spent choosing the right one. Whether we’re seeking advice on how to lose weight, get leaner, or increase muscle strength, most of us turn to people who are experts in this field. In fact, there are a number of researched and proven nutritionists and weight loss practitioners who are interested in providing the best possible recommendations, helping their patients to lose weight consistently.
Do you know that eating can result in weight loss? Yes, it means. once you eat the right ratio of right nutrition you'll maintain a healthy body with the specified shape. By following the proper diet one can make the right nutrient supply to their body. When there's a scarcity of essential nutrients it results in chances of other health disorders by weight gain.
Losing several pounds does not happen overnight. You can't melt fat and burn calories with a wave of a magic wand, and there is no miracle pill that will make you lose weight instantly. However, there are additional treatments that can be combined with diet and regular physical activity that can help you lose weight. This is the case, for example, with certain food supplements, which can promote drainage and elimination, regulate appetite, or even act as an appetite suppressant. For its part, homeopathy can come as a complement to rebalance transit, provide vitamins necessary during a diet, etc. In fact, they are not strictly speaking drugs, prescribed by the medical profession and recognized as being effective for weight loss, but rather aids which help the person to lose weight more easily and to follow his slimming program on a daily basis. So be careful not to let yourself be seduced by so-called formidable pills without doing any research, but without foundation or proof of their effectiveness, which would make you lose weight without doing anything.
What it does in practice is to make you switch to a low-fat diet, because you absolutely don’t want to know what doing #2 looks like if you ate too much fat when on Orlistat. Suffice to say that the fat just goes right through your body.
The key to weight loss is patience and faith. Many people have successfully lost weight, how about you?.
One secret supplement, every member of the lean, ripped, muscular, happy and productive human elite use….
Now I’m gonna be honest with you. Whatever product or service you’ll use in the future, you’ll still need to put in effort in your weight loss journey.
Supplementation might be a helpful way to boost your weight loss results, but formulas can’t do anything without your help. Lifting weights, running, and exercising can help to create a caloric deficit while you work on your diet.
Here’s the deal. We know that you might be sceptical of what you’re about to read here. However, we think it is important to inform you that there is a large amount of misinformation and confusion regarding Meticore on the internet.
My brother genuinely asked me to scribble his face when i requested him for his before and after pictures for this post so request everyone who knows him personally to avoid any personal comments.
The market is loaded up with a wide range of weight reduction arrangements, going from trend diets to weight reduction pills that case to be the following best thing.
Any weight loss drugs which actually work are on prescription only. Most of them are expensive and will not be considered unless you are at severe health risk due to obesity, because they come with side-effects.

Liver removes toxins. If your liver is unable to remove toxins, it means you have a liver failure, kindly visit a real doctor before resorting to this Detoxifying syrups.
I am not a doctor by profession. I am a technologist with a B.Tech degree from IIT Kharagpur. Since my college days, I had the notion that since the cause of a disease is subtle, its cure should also be subtle. Such cure cannot be fully achieved by swallowing those colourful, throat-choking, round or pellet or betel shaped solid lumps, prescribed by the practitioners of Allopathic medicine. Administering these necessitates fooling our bodies’ first line of defence, a tickling saliva laced tongue, against entry of biologically harmful stuff to our stomach. So, these medicines actually do a tresspass.
Opponents of Homeopathy belong to category 1. They want evidence. They want Homeopathy to go through the same rigorous trials that modern medicine did.
No. Homeopathy doesn’t work for anything. It’s physically impossible for it to work. It is literally the stupidest of all pseudoscientific “alternative” medicines.
I have seen my mother go to her clinic, religiously, on a daily basis, even if she's sick herself, for the last 20 years. She goes there, before her scheduled time, and comes back, after the specified time-frame of the working hours of the clinic. And on a daily basis, she gives medicines to 20-40 patients. She has atleast 5-10 new cases every week. Patients wait for half an hour to 2 hours (she doesn't have an appointment system, like most other places in India, it is more a walk-in, first-come-first-serve basis clinic.) to get to talk to her, tell her about their problems and then get their medicines for the next week(s). And every afternoon or night (depending on which part of the day she's working) I see her come home with a content face, with the feeling that screams 'I made a difference in someone's life today. I helped them lead a better life..
Postulated by a physician Samuel Hahnevann all the way back in the 1700s, 'The 'Law of similars' states that Like cures like'. A remedy to an ailment produces symptoms which are similar to the ailment itself. Coffee acts as a stimulant and makes a person more energetic and prevents them from sleeping. According to this bizarre explanation, a person who is suffering from restlessness can be cured by administering coffee (which produces symptoms similar to that of the ailment) . How can the public be so gullible to believe that coffee, a universally known stimulant can be used to cure insomnia and restlessness?.
The most remarkable so far has been a family friend with a debilitating neurological condition who had spent their whole life being (not to put too fine a point to it) run around by conventional doctors offering conflicting, ineffective, and sometimes borderline malicious treatment. Some years of treatment by an excellent homeopath (hats off) have reduced the symptoms to an unprecedented degree, and allowed them to put their life together—it’s impressive to watch.
From my personal experience, it all depends on how good your homeopath is. Unlike allopathy, there is no ‘one’ medicine that cures a particular ailment in homeopathy. The system believes that ailments are inter-related and it requires a trained mind to unearth the cause and customize your meds and dosage to get the desired effects.
Before jumping to how homeopathy being superior or inferior with no side effects, first let us understand how a drig works. Our bodies is composed of cells and each cells are made up of receptor ( Intracellular receptors, nuclear receptors, Muscarinic receptor, nicotinic receptor etc). Several cells share similar type of receptors ( Like Lungs and smooth muscles share M3 receptors, cerebral cortex and salivary glands share M1 receptor etc). So the side effects you see on heart with administration of drugs in bronchial asthma, justifies the drug is working well on the lungs.
This means that the homeopathic sugar pills were no more effective than non-magic sugar pills. Not really surprising. The placebo effect is not going to prevent malaria or cure AIDS or any of the other ridiculously dangerous claims that are made by homeopaths. Stick to evidence-based medicine, and you won't go wrong. Rely on evidence-free so-called alternative medicines, and you'll suffer.
Homeopathy is based on a principle of “like cures like.” In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person, can in infinitesimal doses, treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger the body’s natural defenses. Treatments are “individualized” that is they are tailored to each person and it is common for different people with the same condition to receive different treatments. It is a very holistic approach to your body hence an individual is taken as a whole and not just the diseased organ or part.
So what exactly is the question, does homeopathy work as a medical(ish) treatment or do homeopathic compounds have biologic activity? The doctors at MD Anderson don't care what anyone thinks and settled the second part of this with a study using breast cancer cells and homeopathic medicines/compounds in a dilution which you all say has no actual stuff in it. Guess what? The answer they got was yes it does. And since they were using breast cancer cells and not people, there is no placebo affect. Just because it doesn't make sense, doesn't mean the results aren't valid and since the results were published in a peer reviewed journal means the study and results were vetted by people with more expertise than anyone in this forum.
In 1796, when Samuel Hahnemann invented the concept of homeopathy, allopathic medicine was often toxic, scary and ineffective (blood letting), since our knowledge of pathophysiology and medicine at that time was almost non existent, also a belief system, mostly unproven but taken from ancient books written by the famous Arabic (and Greek) physicians of the olden times, not empirical. So the chances of survival would often be better on homeopathic medicine.
The entire theoretical framework of homeopathy is nonsense. The idea that you can reverse the effect of a chemical by diluting in water sufficiently is wrong. It’s just completely, utterly wrong. Your typical homeopathic dilution is literally a glass of water with a drop of alcohol in it. There is no active ingredient.
However, if you test it under blinded conditions against placebo, it performs no differently. When people do not know whether they are getting a homeopathic formulation or a dose of water (well, actually, for all practical purposes, those are the same), they do not show any different response to the homeopathic treatment.
Yes, it actually works.. At the age of 16 I was diagnosed with chronic tonisilities. For 2 years, I suffered terrible pain and couldnt eat and talk, there was no hope.. I went to many ENT specialists in Guwahati. The only solution is to surgery because an antibiotic last for only 1 month. Then I went to Apollo Chennai. It was all same , they also prescribed antibiotics and told for immediate surgery. Then , one day my relative told me about a homeopathy clinic , I went to that homeopathy clinic in Guwahati, I started taking medicine Carcinocin for around 7 to 8 months. After, 3 months of taking medicine, I just got much relief and within a year I am completely cured. Now, my age is 22 and I havent got any tonsilities after then.. I am so happy about this system and I have faith in it.
Homeopathy is a complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). This means that homeopathy is different from treatments that are part of conventional Western medicine in important ways.
Homeopathy is most popular alternative medicine practice. In India it is very popular. But some people has doubt about homeopathy. There is enough reasons for doubt. Homeopathy is not as clinically proven like Allopathy. Many people claim it a pseudoscience. But reality is that homeopathy is effective. In India each year millions of people are being cured by Homeopathy.
Yes. There is no need for any believe in the medicine too. I had given homeo medicine for my pet animal cat and could save the side effects of fish having ammoina. Once a parrot arrived at my home, which was sick and cannot stand properly. I gave some food, but failed to take food and her eyes shows severe sadness. Noting the same, by holding the bird, I gave sepia 30x two drops with water ( I had a fear about its attack. Due to severe illness, it cannot do anything. So I could wide open the peck and gave the medicine.). Within one hour, marked improvement noted and thereafter took food and water. The parrot was not mine and I loved all pet animals very much. Later I got information that it belongs to nearby family and the same escaped by opening the door of the cage. It was very friendly one even though I had fear in mind on seeing its peculiar peck. I wanted to provide help and save the bird from illness. One day our cat caught ill after eating fresh fish from a fish seller. My house is very near to the road and just by hearing the sound of horn of the vehicle, she expressed her uncontrollable desire and later she got fresh fish from the seller. Within one hour she became ill and her look became very sad. A two days before, there was an article in the leading newspaper regarding the use of ammonia as preservative. Noting the same, I gave ammonium carb 30x. After one hour I noticed a slight improvement and after 4pm, it comes to normal stage. All other cats in the locality,which got fish from the seller were killed. But our one only survived and that fish seller had to cancel our route too on account of fear. The cure was only due to homeopathic effect. In all cases, we depended only on homeopathy. For curing of illness of domesticated animals like cow, cat, duck, hen etc. Every time through homeo, we could get brilliant result and we noticed that homeo is effective for both man and animals too. We have many such experiences and in all cases we could see excellent results.
Whether homeopathy works, or not, has nothing to do with homeopathy. It is determined by your definition of “works”. In conventional medicine, most medicines make no attempt to cure, they are designed to address signs and symptoms. If they successfully (defined as better than a placebo) address signs and symptoms some of the time (eg. in some clinical studies), they are considered to “work”. Cured is not defined and not a goal for any disease not caused by a parasite, so most medicines make no claim, and no attempt to work.
There is no legitimate scientific basis to homeopathic medicine, and there are no properly conducted scientific studies that show it has any meaningful ability to cure -- or even improve -- any condition. Though given that homeopathic remedies are basically just water or sugar pills, in large enough quantities they'd probably do a good job on dehydration or low blood sugar levels.
And homeopathy isn't harmless. It trains people to try useless treatments for serious medical conditions, and avoid real proven treatments. Homeopaths in general are more likely to reject vaccinations. It substitutes woo (unfounded or ridiculous ideas) for science. And, of course, it means that the purveyors of homeopathy are preying on the gullibility of the sick and suffering.
As none were available, I consulted a homeopath, she gave me two sugar pills to put under my tongue, one now, and one later. pain disappeared over night and has NEVER returned, that was 15 years ago.
There is no plausible physical mechanism by which it could work, and in any case, hundreds of studies have been conducted into homeopathy, and as a result scientists can say with a very high degree of certainty that when rigorously tested (i.e. double-blind randomised controlled trials) it does not perform better than placebo.
Whether it is a painting, drawing, dance, music, writing, collage, other crafts, or any combination of the above, it is a way for the artist to hold on to an idea, feeling, or thought, and express it through the chosen art form which is then the physical manifestation of the artist's idea, feeling, or thought.
There are many purposes. To some it is an expression of their lives. To others it is to inspire. To some it is to tell a story or to give people a glimpse into what life was like before we had cameras and video. But then you have stuff like this which makes you wonder “where did we go wrong culturally.
I work in a hospital. I’m only a lowly psychologist (lower, in fact — an assistant psychologist), so I’m not saving lives in the most direct sense, but every day I go home with a little flicker of pride that maybe I made someone’s life a little better. Maybe I gave them advice that made it a little easier to handle being sick, to play with their children again, to enjoy life.
Art surrounds life, all people in every location, without us being aware of it. Since time immemorial, art has existed as long as man has. It is a huge part of our culture, which shapes our ideas, and vice versa, and provides us with a deeper understanding of emotions, self-awareness, and more. Defined as one of the seven elements of art, next to line, shape, space, form, texture, and color, the value in art is a quality or a value of light and dark of a certain shade or tone. This art element is best understood if visualized as a scale or a gradient.
I have come across many attempts to answer this question. Mostly it shrinks down to the vague, sheepish and carefully polite answer that -art is an expression of abstraction. People think it is safe to regard art as next to something supernatural and almost alien.
I set out to try and look as to what great minds and great artists opinions of this question are and were. What I began to see is that like art itself there are as many interpretations of this answer as there are artists and patrons of the arts. However I think some compelling trends and common ground can be found amongst these quotes.
Art is important in life because it is an expression of our soul. We communicate through our art and through it can express the intangible. As well, art adds beauty and meaning to our lives.
ART seems to fix this naturally occurring “glitch”, with some MENTAL FLUFF, to polster the mind from overexhaustion, by unused self-aggregation, which spins out of control, it is like a nebulous cloud, which protects your mind from getting skin cancer, by the brawling sun of it”s own trapped consciousness, in a glass cabinet.
I am currently a full time student of the Dhrupad form of Indian Classical Music (The oldest surviving form of Indian Music..). I live in a Gurukul run by the Gundecha Brothers, Padmashree Award winning artists (Padmashree is the 4th highest Civilian honor in India. It's quite a big deal!) learning from them in the traditional Guru-Shishya style of learning.
Art is an attempt to communicate something, pure and simply. If we're talking visual art, then it's an attempt to communicate something visually...if we're talking 'arts' in general, then I'd say it's an attempt to communicate through whichever form(s) you're using - movement, spoken word, words, sound, moving pictures, etc.
Some of you might say it is a sketch of a cute little girl. Some will go further and will say there is her reflection also. Few may think there is a hidden message in her reflection like something related to factories and deforestation. A few will go ahead in their imagination and will say, it represents the future of this girl if we don’t start caring about Earth.
Art is the effort to turn the invisible into visible. It is the result from the creative process of a given individual, and is meant to touch that within others which is immaterial, abstract, insubstantial, "etheric". You could call this, emotions, memories, thoughts, or maybe even the spiritual self. You can maybe call multiple of these, or none, or use different words.
She would climb up this tree every morning, to sit there for hours looking at the world from above. Because the tree grew right next to the bus stop, she would watch out for a school bus arriving every day to collect all the kids, notifying her friends how far the bus was. She would climb up to watch the sunsets every evening, being fascinated how colourful the sky could get. And some days, she would wake up early to watch sunrises too.
Life stops nowhere, they say. It keeps on running and you've got to keep the pace with it. Sure, it does! The race of getting the highest marks in the class, of getting through entrance examinations, of getting into the best college, of getting a good and decent job, and this goes on forever, until we die. Within these conventional races that we helplessly become a part of, there are small and big struggles that we face everyday. But what we forget about, while running relentlessly, is that life is meant to be lived, and that part of “life”, in this process of respiration that supposedly keeps us 'alive', is what we call ART.
I prefer to consume (and create) art without any purpose. It's sensual for me, which means that I like to look at it (listen to it, etc) and have a response. I suppose you argue that, for me, the purpose of art is to give me something to respond to. But that seems like a weak use of the word "purpose" to me.
Art is the experience of the mysterious, it is the communication medium for those in need of some changes through the imagination world created by the artist or healing power who have been through pain, it could also be the entertainment who is in search of happiness.
I am surprised by the fact that no one has replied to this question. I am happy to attempt to answer it though. In fact, this is a question I have been thinking about a lot lately. As a student, it always seemed that all these arts related subjects were what took us (me and my classmates) further. But one might ask: "How?".
When I refer to “the arts“ I mean all of the arts: painting and sculpture, architecture, dance, music, literature, theater, film, and crafts such as jewelry and pottery-making —-any creative endeavor one can be involved in or watch as a performance. These are just a few of the things that art does for all of us.
Art is a way to express many things. It's a way to deal with feelings that cannot be expressed through typical means like conversation or words. Art gives a way to express your emotions.Art comforts man through poems, literature, songs, drama and cinema. Art lovers can spend their whole life working for art. Art serves to fulfil the desire of man to transcend the death and decay to which all earthly things are subject.
Yes because art is an expression, so you can express using traditional methods, you can express using non traditional methods, you can express using steel, or stone, food, fabric and it will still be art.
I suppose that I’ll give you the chance to decide. This is my digital art. Since coming across this medium, I never turned back. I could quickly illustrate my thoughts and actions. I could spend anywhere from hours to minutes creating pieces and relieving myself from oppressive anxiety and overflowing emotions.
It does mean that I spent several years of my life focused on traditional art methodologies like painting and drawing and printmaking, in media like pencil and acrylic and oil paint, and charcoal and oil and chalk pastel. I’ve tried clay and mixed media in two and three dimensions.
The question here is not is it art or isn't it but really the debate on digital vs traditional art styles comes down to "Do we treat digital art with the same respect as we treat traditional art and should we value these mediums equally?".
It reminds me my colleague from art school. We both had the same young teacher of painting. One day, he criticised her. (Well, she really did painted an aweful nose, so the figure looked like Swedish troll from the profile. But this guy wasn't mean, he just pointed out an anatomical mistake.) Since then she had harbored great resentment to him. When he died tragically, I remember her words: “And good! He wasn't a real artist at all!" When I asked, why she thought so, she said.
In saying that art being “good” is subject to the person. I really enjoy looking at art of all kinds. When I see a picture and feel something that the artists has intended to portray, then they are a good artist. That is why even abstract art like Picasso paintings are looked up to, because of the feeling he portrays.
How the audience perceives the end result is a matter of personal taste. The issue this question brings up is a personal debate between the ego of the artists and their followers. Is it easier for a digital painter to get to a desired result more quickly than if she were to use physical media? Most likely yes. The power of “undo” cannot be underestimated. That’s why most switch hitting artists do their commercial works digitally, then do their esoteric works in traditional media. Some artists are strictly digital because that may have been the most affordable medium for them to start. Their ability to master the medium to visualize their thoughts for everyone to see is still magical. It’s still an art.
Meh, I mean, it depends on what you are looking for, most martial arts are supposed to be effective in real combat, so it depends on your style, your personality, what you want to learn, your build characteristics. Many martial arts need considerable physical capabilities, while others focus primarily on pure technique. You can become a fighting beast without being extremely strong physically.
This overvaluation is mainly because traditional martial arts do not fit the modern world. They were developed in different times and under different circumstances from which we are now far removed. Furthermore, the fact that arts no longer receive rigorous testing (on the battlefield) has allowed some modern teachers of traditional arts or modern derivatives of them to teach, frankly, bullshit with impunity. The core of the arts themselves were once proven, their traditions having survived conflict after conflict.
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) 100%. Women typically don’t have to worry about being jumped by several people. Their concern is more for Sexual assault or boyfriend/husband (domestic abuse) for a one on one situation especially man vs woman BJJ is where it’s at. It is all based on Levers and Fulcrums so you don’t need a lot of strength to utilize the vast majority. I’m fact this style was designed especially to be used by a weaker person against a much stronger.
You can’t really describe all of the methods and systems used for fighting as martial arts, in the strict sense of the word, as they are not formal schools with a syllabus and grades - which is what most of us think of when the term ‘martial art’ is used. Some of the best methods for hand to hand fighting can’t really be termed martial arts, at least in the formal sense of the word. On the other hand some might say that anything trained for combat is a martial art - such as rifle shooting. So I guess it depends on how you define the term martial art in the first place.
This question is very difficult. Mainly because there are many types of "real world situations". Some systems were created for areas with lots of war. For civilians, these systems may not really be usefull all the time. If you train Krav Maga but your opponent is your uncle who had a few too many drinks and suddenly becomes a bit too aggressive, Krav's violent nature may not be the correct response.
The novice has to begin to understand the difference, and to separate action from art (under a specific name), and technique from tactics or strategy. Any instructor at any school teaching a quality program of ANY Martial Art system can teach you techniques that will work and be "effective," or "useful" in any situation. The choice of individual techniques to be applied range from strikes (with closed fists, open knife-hands, feet, knees, elbows, etc.) to throwing (sweeps, trips, reaps, flips and any take-down) to grappling (joint locks, pressure points, choke holds, and other restraints as well as the escapes and counters to release yourself).
Im going to give you a straight answer from my experience and not some fucking summary about how your best defense is to run, yes in certain situations running is the best option but in stand up fights and heat of the moments you stand your ground. I’ve been in martial arts for quite some time now and I’ve seen many varieties of martial arts and fights that include them. My top 5 martial arts that are most effective in the streets due to experience first hand and eye witness my self are ...
Slow Metabolism is the main reason for weight gain which leads cravings to food and stores your fat in belly, thighs and butt.Whereas Fast Metabolism boosts burning up your Fat like a butter in a microwave. some of them try ketogenic, low carb diets, workouts but finally what they end up losing one or two pounds and they lose confidence in these methods but sure it works if they are consistent in their methods. There are also risks involved in being overweight. If you're overweight, you're 62 percent, more likely to have a heart attack, 64 percent more likely to have a stroke 81 percent more likely to have coronary artery disease, and 22 percent more likely to get Alzheimer's. But if you have way to improve your metabolism through a veggie pill along with your workout you can experience a fast result. This pill is all Natural made of African Mango Extract and Fucoxanthin (Pigments in sea weeds) which will boost your metabolism to burn your fat.
The National Institute of Health has one of the best online web websites on weight reduction tablet components. After analyzing different products, the NIH concludes that many can assist consumers with losing weight and with minimum clinical help.
Whether it is prescribed by doctors or can be bought over the counter, there is a best weight loss drug that you can take to help you lose that excessive weight you've been wanting to shed off without going through strenuous exercises. The best weight loss drug should be able to do the any or more of the following things.
Please don't take any pills to lose weight. They are not healthy and their effectiveness wanes over time. Don't try any outlandish diets either. Choose an eating pattern you can adhere to for the rest of your life. Abstain from refined carbohydrates, don't cater for your sweet tooth, but once a week it is fine if you take care of the young upstart (sic!) Wholewheat bread is very tasteful, therefore don't eat white bread. Also: don't fast. If you do your body will soon start 'thinking' you are starving it, with the result that it will cling to the fat it has, resulting in zero fat loss.
Long term weight loss is best achieved by developing healthy habits . No pill is needed, or should be considered, unless under doctor’s guidance. Eating less processed foods and more vegetables, exercising more and doing other things to balance hormones, such as leptin and ghrelin, is key. Reflection on habits that caused weight gain and development of a sound plan to move forward is needed. Pills are rarely needed.
None. Weight loss pills are marketed to play on your insecurities. Not to mention, they really f* up your body for the long run. I would suggest making better eating choices slowly but surely and adding minimal exercise to your daily routine. If you're looking for a ‘quick fix’ I regret to tell you there is none. Trust me, ive tried a lot.
Absolutely NO, the only way to lose weight is to eat less than your needs calories, for example, if you need daily 2000 calories to maintain your weight then you need 1600-1800 to lose weight. That's it.
The weight loss with by far the strongest evidence for actually working is not a pill but a daily SQ injection. The medication, Liraglutide, ( marketed as Saxenda for weight loss and as Victoza for treatment of type 2 diabetes) works by mimicking the “satiety hormone “ GLP-1 in the GI system and in the CNS thus reducing appetite and reversing insulin resistance associated with obesity and a prediabetic state.
Nearly all weight loss pills now are basically caffeine pills — green tea, etc. operate using similar methods and the research isolating coffee and green tea as being particularly effective are generally flawed. Caffeine is one of the least effective stimulants, but it’s also incredibly safe. Caffeine can cause you to burn an extra 10 calories…maybe.
There is an awesome pill you can take to lose weight… and the more you take, the faster you lose the weight. Please stay with me here… It is also easily available - you can fine it online, as well as local stores like Walmart and target. But the biggest problem is that the pill is very hard to swallow. I mean so hard that most people that try it abandon it within 2–3 days. Some stick with it for bit longer, like 7 to 10 days. It’s not that you have to take it 3 times a day. You can take it as little as once every two days. But the key is consistency. If you miss one day you must make up. If you wait few days then the pill becomes hard to swallow again. Ok I know.. what is the pill… well its quite popular and I am sure you have heard of it… ready? No seriously? The hardest pill to swallow to lose weight is diet and exercise… now tell me isn’t that hard to swallow? But you also know that’s the truth.
Here’s a funny but true story. People at a local church had a person who had some pills that seemed to really work for weight loss. So word got around and soon a number of people were distributing these pills to parishioners in the church. Eventually it was discovered that the pills contained methamphetamine. So, yeah, certain drugs may work, but I damn sure wouldn’t take them.
In broad terms, lowering your weight and exercising moderately should lower your blood sugar levels somewhat, but you would still need at least oral medication and proper monitoring by a medical professional.
This is the result of the UK DIRECT Study by Professor Michael Lean, those who, after 6 months on a 825–875 Cal. diet (which I feel many participants weren’t able to keep to), could keep their weight in check after two years, of those having consistantly lost >15 kg of weight 70% had their diabetes in remission, meaning no meds needed, without med glucose parameters normal.
In every case make sure to discuss your treatment plan with your doctor in detail as diabetes is best managed when you are aware of the action of each drug and the side effects of each medicine.
There were large trials showing in type 2 diabetes patients that pills were not as good as insulin injections in controlling hemoglobin A1C levels or controlling after meal blood sugars optimally. We also knew from studies with type 1 diabetics that there was less mortality in patients who were treated with 3 or 4 insulin injections per day.
However, the “dogma”(or the prevailing teaching) in the 1980’s was that type 1 diabetes should be treated with insulin and type 2 diabetes should be treated with pills. On the positive note diabetologists (diabetes specialists) have been able to study the metabolic syndrome (=syndrome of insulin resistance) in more detail and how this can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes type 2.
Which medicine should you be taking to control your diabetes? That's a question that needs to be answered after your doctor takes into account several important factors, such as your personal medical history, including your heart health and your risk of kidney disease. As your doctor has no doubt told you, just having type 2 diabetes (T2D) puts you at increased risk of having heart disease and so both conditions should be tackled simultaneously.
Ibdoma ‘s question What is the accurate medicine for diabetes? - Your question is quite vague. By accurate medicine, I suppose you mean best. Diabetes is 7 different types of diseases, 4 are diabetes insipidus which causes excessive thirst and urination without elevated blood glucose levels. There are 3 main types of diabetes mellitus which are marked by elevated blood glucose levels, plus the symptoms of excessive thirst and urination are often present.
