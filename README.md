# ML-project
This project is aimed at helping companies to check whether their website is adapted for customer use. The model will label the content of the web-page with one of two categories: user-friendly or user-unfriendly. If the model predicts that the page falls upon the second category, the cause of unfriendliness will be identified (excessive terminology, didacticism, indifference/coldness, obtrusiveness). The number of these causes as well as their naming can be changed).

The dataset for this model will be created from scratch and will contain the links to vivid examples of web-pages and corresponding labels (user-friendly, didactic, obtrusive etc).
