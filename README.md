ML problem: binary text classification (whether the topic of the text is IT-oriented or not)

The dataset for this model is created from scratch and contains two files: it_oriented.TXT and ordinary.TXT, each containing approxiately 500 paragraphs of text. The dataset is subjected to changes (e.g. more data can be added)

Code I used to create and train the model is to be found in the file training_itornot.ipynb
Code for testing on unseen data is in the file testing_itornot.ipynb
